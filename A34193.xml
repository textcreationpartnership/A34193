            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT may be expected by thoſe that knew the Reverend Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of theſe Sermons, and the publick Station he was in for ſeveral years in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> as Divinity Profeſſor there, that he ſhould have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the World with another ſort of Work, I mean his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures which he there read, and were compoſed with great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Accuracy and Judgment. But that it ſeems is not ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his native modeſty,
<pb facs="tcp:61506:5"/>who chuſes rather to live and die in a kind of obſcurity, than be ſet <hi>as a city upon an hill;</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues himſelf more upon the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had to a Parochial Cure, and the Capacity he was in of doing good to the Souls of men, than of being in one of the moſt publick Stations in the Church: And in which, ſince by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Sight, and other Infirmities of Age, he has been no longer able to ſerve, he thought, by publiſhing ſome Practical Diſcourſes preach'd in that Auditory, he might, though he be in a ſenſe dead, yet ſpeak, and be uſeful among them.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſes are ſuch as he uſually compoſed, plain and practical, and ſuited to the meaneſt Capacity.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61506:5"/>
            <p>And if there be any thing that is not of that nature (as there is very little) and which the Author, had he had the laſt peruſal, would have reviſed; the Error is to be imputed to the Publiſher, to whoſe care and choice they were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſes ſometimes are large, and comprehend ſeveral Sermons, though under the title of one, but it was not well to be prevented; and which the Reader however may well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with.</p>
            <p>The Two laſt Sermons are Occaſional, but the occaſion ſuch as will render them profitable to all.</p>

               <p>The words of my Text (not to ſpend time in any unneceſſary Preface to what I have to ſay) we may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently reſolve into theſe four Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>

               <p>Paſſing by the three former, the laſt of theſe Propoſitions is that which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at preſent to inſiſt on, as being the chief thing intended in this portion of holy Scripture. Concerning the ſenſe of which Propoſition, a few words will be neceſſary to be premiſed, before I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61506:11"/>proceed to lay down the grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This is <hi>The condemnation,</hi> not ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and excluſively as to all other things, as if nothing elſe could condemn a man, but ſignally and emphatically, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the great meritorious cauſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt puniſhment. I ſay, the rejection of the light of the Goſpel, or not giving it due entertainment, is not the only thing that condemns men. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe Heathens unto whom the light of the Scriptures never came, ſhall not therefore be exempted from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The Apoſtle hath taught us, <hi>That as many as have ſinned without the law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall alſo periſh without the law.</hi> Their ſins againſt their natural light, and the Law of Nature written in their hearts, ſhall condemn them; there ſhall be no need of calling in the aſſiſtance of the Law externally promulged, and written in Tables of Stone; much leſs of the Goſpel, to give evidence againſt them.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, if the Goſpel were never offered them, and they ſhut up under a moral impoſſibility of being acquainted with it, we cannot apprehend how their not believing ſhould be charged
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61506:11"/>upon them as their ſin. <hi>Aquinas</hi> hath rightly ſtated this matter;
<note place="margin">22dae Quaeſt. 10. Artic. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Si infidelitas ſumatur ſecundum negationem puram, ſi cut in illis qui nihil audiverunt de fide, non habet rationem peccati:</hi> pure negative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, or a meer not believing in thoſe who never heard any thing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, hath not the nature of ſin. And this was likewiſe St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s judgment, as appears by the Expoſition he gives of the words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come unto them, they had had no ſin: Loquitur de peccato quo non credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt in Chriſtum, Our Saviour ſpeaketh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of the ſin of not believing in Chriſt.</hi> Though they had been guilty of many other ſins, yet their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving had not been imputed to them. And the reaſon hereof is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had never a power in <hi>Adam</hi> of believing that which was never made known unto them; there being a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple incompoſſibility and repugnancy in the nature of the thing, that a man ſhould by faith aſſent to, and embrace that, which he was never in the leaſt acquainted with, which was never as much as propounded to him to be the object of his faith. <hi>How ſhall we believe on him of whom we have not heard?</hi> Rom.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61506:12"/>10.14. 'Tis a queſtion that cannot be anſwered. <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, with all that ſtrength which he received from God, could not have done it; and therefore neither can that be required of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, which he himſelf never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for ſuch as have the Goſpel publiſhed to them, and finally perſevere in unbelief, neither is their unbelief the only ſin for which they are condemn'd. What ſober man can think that one ſin can expunge another? that mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief ſhould take off and extinguiſh the guilt of all their other ſins, ſo as none of them ſhould at all come under conſideration, when Chriſt pronounceth the condemnatory Sentence? They who ſhould entertain ſo wild a phanſy, muſt have forgotten the form of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at the laſt day, as Chriſt himſelf hath deſcribed it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. where expreſs mention is made of other ſins, as the ground of the Sentence to be then pronounced.</p>
               <p>Yet I deny not but that in a limited ſenſe, wicked men living under the light of the Goſpel, may be ſaid to be condemned only for their unbelief; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they had believed, none of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61506:12"/>other ſins ſhould have condemned them. But now, they not believing, the guilt of all their other ſins againſt the Law abideth on them; and beſides, there is an addition of further guilt by their great ſin againſt the Goſpel; and this their ſin againſt the Goſpel, is that which preſſeth them moſt heavily, and hath the ſoreſt influence upon the final Sentence for the inflaming and heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
               <p>So then, theſe things being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, we have the ſenſe of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition before us. This is <hi>The condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the matter and meritorious cauſe of the moſt ſore and dreadful condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>that light being come into the world,</hi> the Goſpel being publiſhed, and Chriſt in the Goſpel being tendered to the Sons of men, they ſlight and refuſe this light, preferring darkneſs before it, and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to continue in their ſins, though it coſt them dear, than to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt to their everlaſting bliſs and happineſs.</p>
               <p>Now the grounds of the Propoſition, together with the equity of that ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which it imports, will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto us, if we take into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration theſe enſuing particulars.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61506:13"/>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis light that is refuſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with an affront put upon it, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being preferred before it. Now in this alone there are ſeveral things which do not a little aggravate a man's ſin, and by conſequence, heighten his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When a man goes on againſt light, there is more of the formality of ſin, than where light is wanting: There is a direct and plain oppoſition againſt the Rule, an intentional <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity: whereas, in caſe of ignorance, the Rule indeed was violated material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not formally and wittingly as ſuch. Our Saviour lays much ſtreſs upon this for the greatning of a man's ſin.
<note place="margin">Joh. 9.41.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin;</hi> that is, none in compariſon of what now you have. And to the ſame effect is that of St. <hi>James, To him that knoweth to do good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch. 4.17.</note> 
                  <hi>and doeth it not, to him it is ſin;</hi> that is, ſin to the purpoſe, ſin of no ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is done againſt light, hath not only an inconformity to the Rule, but ſome degree of contempt thereof. Wherefore in ſuch caſes God looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61506:13"/>himſelf as deſpiſed. <hi>Why haſt thou deſpiſed the commandment of the Lord?</hi> ſaid he to <hi>David,</hi> when he had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and deliberately ſinned, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It argues Corruption to have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten head, and to have grown up to a great meaſure of ſtrength and maturity; it argues ſuch a perſon to be ſet upon ſin, and wholly bent to gratify himſelf therein, whatſoever ſhall come of it. When the light it ſelf ſhall ſtand in a man's way, and flaſh in his face, and yet he will go on, he acts as one ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſin, as nothing ſhall take him off. This, in the language of the Scipture, is to ſin preſumptuouſly, by which a man under the Law was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have <hi>reproached the Lord;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof, no leſs puniſhment was appointed than the utter cutting him off from among his people, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.30, 31.</p>
               <p>And thus far I have only inſiſted on the conſideration of light more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: 'Tis light that is refuſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; and therefore neither the ſin, nor the puniſhment of the perſon ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, can be ſmall.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61506:14"/>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis not any kind of light, but Goſpel light, that is ſo ill treated; and this hath yet much more in it, than all that hath been hitherto mentioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The light of the Goſpel is a clearer light. All other light is but darkneſs to this. The Heathens had the light of Nature for their guide; but yet they were ſtill in darkneſs till the Goſpel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened them; for the very Errand of the Goſpel to them was, to open their eyes,
<note place="margin">Acts 26.18.</note> 
                  <hi>and to turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> under the diſpenſations of the Law, had much more light; and yet were heavenly things in great part ſo vail'd and wrapt up in Types and Shadows, as their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of Goſpel-times ſeems to have been but as the morning ſpread upon the Mountains, to the noon day-light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a light that preſents to our view the moſt excellent and moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things. <hi>Pardon of ſin,</hi> Acts 10.43. <hi>Peace with God,</hi> Rom. 5.1. <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life,</hi> John 3.36. <hi>A kingdom that cannot be ſhaken,</hi> Heb. 12.28. <hi>An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, undefiled, that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. <hi>Such things as neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61506:14"/>heard, nor have entred into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe excellent things which the light of the Goſpel ſets before us, are ſuch as were by infinite Wiſdom and unſpeakable Love deſigned and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for us before the foundations of the World were laid. The moſt wiſe and gracious God did in nothing more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the unſearchable Treaſures of his Wiſdom, and the Riches of his Grace, than in the Contrivance of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch a way, as in which Mercy and Juſtice ſo admirably meet together, and Righteouſneſs and Peace kiſs each other. We cannot therefore refuſe or ſlight theſe excellent things, without a manifeſt diſparagement of the Wiſdom and Love of God; as if neither the one, nor the other, were conſiderable herein; and as if after all that God hath done, the things ſo wifely deſigned, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly proffer'd, were not worth our acceptance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Goſpel preſſeth the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of theſe excellent things with the moſt cogent and forcible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 'Tis not laid before us as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of indifferency, whether we will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace what's tendered, or refuſe it. We
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61506:15"/>are told and aſſured, that as the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the things proffered will render us unſpeakably bleſſed and happy to eternity, ſo the refuſal of them will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make us everlaſtingly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably miſerable. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, ſhall be ſaved; but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.16.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſides the external tender of theſe things in the Goſpel, the Spirit of God uſually more or leſs accompanies the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Miniſtration of the Goſpel, inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly working together with it, treating with us, and ſolliciting the matters of our peace by Enlightnings and Convictions, by ſtirring up good Motions and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Purpoſes and Reſolutions, which makes our refuſal of mercy after all this, much more worthy of the ſevereſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Add to all this, the conſideration of the greatneſs of the Perſon who at firſt publiſhed the Goſpel, and made tender of thoſe excellent things to the World himſelf, while here on Earth; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtill continues to do it by his Servants. The Lord of Life and Glory, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever, came in perſon from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61506:15"/>Heaven out of the Boſome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on this very Errand, that he might <hi>make reconciliation for ſin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 9.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs.</hi> And offer the fruits and benefit of all to Mankind, making this general Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If but an Earthly Prince ſhould ſend his only Son to the remoteſt Parts of his Dominions, on purpoſe to make tender of ſome great thing to one of his meaneſt Subjects, what an indignity, and how intolerable an affront would it be, if that his tender ſhould be ſlighted! But here the King Eternal ſends his only Son from Heaven to offer us Everlaſting Life, and we entertain him no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, than as if he came in a needleſs Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy; for ſo much our moſt unworthy carriage towards him imports, if we do not accept of his Tenders. This the Scripture inſiſts on as a circumſtance that carries in it no ſmall aggravation of the ſin of our unbelief. <hi>If the word ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received a juſt recompence of reward; how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at firſt began to be ſpoken to us by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61506:16"/>the Lord!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2.2, 3. Heb. 12.25.</note> And again, <hi>If they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped not who refuſed him who ſpake from earth; much more ſhall not we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, if we refuſe him who ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now put all theſe things together, and I ſee not how you can chuſe but conclude, That as there is no ſin like that which is committed againſt the light of the Goſpel, ſo there is no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment like unto that which will be inflicted for this ſin: or, That <hi>this is the condemnation, That light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light.</hi> And ſo I proceed to the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what hath been ſpoken.</p>

They have had their birth and education where the light of the Goſpel ſhines; and under the influences of that light they have lived. As ſoon as they came into the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61506:16"/>World, they were in Baptiſm dedicated to Chriſt; in that Ordinance they gave their Names to Chriſt, and liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among his Followers and Soldiers; and they never afterwards renounced him, but made profeſſion of him all their days. What reaſon therefore have they to make any queſtion but that Chriſt will own them? They have not been Heathens or Mahumetans: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though Chriſt ſhould turn thoſe wretched Infidels into Hell by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; yet as for themſelves, being Chriſtians, they hope they may well expect more favour from him. Should he deal with them as with Heathens? as with thoſe who never wore his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very? who never made profeſſion of him? who never knew him, or heard of his Name? This were hard meaſure, and ſuch as they think they need not fear at the hands of ſo merciful a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Who ſhould go to Heaven, if not ſuch as themſelves? whom ſhould Chriſt ſave, if not Chriſtians? Alas poor Souls! You think to plead as thoſe who make account that Chriſt is much beholding to you for vouchſafing to be called by his Name. But foraſmuch as profeſſing to know Chriſt, in your
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61506:17"/>Works you deny him; foraſmuch as while you call him your Saviour, you refuſe to be ruled by him as your Lord; foraſmuch as notwithſtanding all the love you pretend to have for him, and his Goſpel, your Actions are ſuch as proclaim you to be thoſe who love darkneſs rather than light, and who hate true Chriſtianity, the reality and power of that which you make profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of; had not Chriſt been more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you, if you had never ſo much as in external profeſſion owned him? If you had never been called by that bleſſed Name, which by your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy lives you have reproached and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned? Many Heathens were never in a capacity of diſhonouring that Name, as having never had the knowledge of it; and your knowledge of Chriſt hath been of no other advantage to you, than only to enable you knowingly to ſlight him, and trample his precious Blood under your feet. Thus you throw dirt in you Saviour's face, while you would ſeem to honour him. <hi>Quid eſt aliud ſanctum vocabulum ſine merito quàm ornamentum in luto,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salvian,</hi> in his 4th Book <hi>de Gubernatione Dei;</hi> The ſacred Name of Chriſtian without faith
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61506:17"/>and holineſs, what is it but an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment trodden under foot in the mire, or a precious Jewel which you have taken and drawn along the Kennel? But you debaucht and vicious Perſons, you wild Ranters, rather than ſober Chriſtians, ſpeak out your inmoſt thoughts: Do you really make account of claiming ſpecial intereſt in Chriſt? and do you in earneſt expect to be owned by him? With what face can you do it, while you continue to be as you are? <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> being at a Banquet, where he was but meanly entertained, and no way ſo as was ſuitable to the dignity of ſo great a Perſon; when the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was over, inſtead of thanking him who had invited him, he only gave him this check in his ear, <hi>Non put abam me tibi tam familiarem; I had not thought that we two had been ſo familiar.</hi> And will not Chriſt thank you much in the like manner, for having been called by his Name, and for reckoning your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe that belong to him, and have a ſpecial intereſt in him? Do you not know how he will at the laſt day entertain you, and in what manner he will declare the ſenſe he hath of your kindneſs? Thou lewd and profligate

But yet this is not all; you ſhall not only be adjudged to Hell with the Heathen that know not God, and all the Families that call not on his Name; but you ſhall be more ſeverely handled in that place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the very Heathens. The Condition of a ſober and temperate Heathen ſhall then be more tolerable,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61506:18"/>than that of a lewd and vicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. And is it not a moſt righteous thing with God that it ſhould be ſo? The Pagan World never had the light that you have been bleſt with: Pagans never had thoſe many gracious Calls and Invitations to Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which you have had: Pagans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the tenders of thoſe glorious things which have in the Goſpel been proffer'd you: The Terrors of the Law, and the torments prepared in Hell for all the people of the World that forget God, were never laid open, and ſet before their eyes, as they have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yours: Pagans never had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe ſtrong Convictions, of thoſe inward Motions and Strivings of the Spirit of God with their Souls, which you have had: And yet after all this, you are in many reſpects much worſe than many Heathens. And will you ſtill think to plead, We are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and ſhould Chriſt deal with us as with Heathens? I tell you once more, no; he will not deal with you as with Heathens: As the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of your Sins have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably greater,

Get your Soul adorned with grace, and then it will be fitter to entertain Gifts. And to preſs this a little more upon you, let me leave with you only theſe three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If Knowledge be excellent and deſirable, Grace is much more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and much more worthy to be the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61506:20"/>Object of our moſt raiſed deſires. After the Apoſtle had been diſcourſing of thoſe extraordinary and miraculous Gifts, which in the Primitive times God was pleaſed to pour out upon Believers, he makes way to his following Diſcourſe of love and grace by this commendatory Preface;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.31.</note> 
                     <hi>Yet ſhew I unto you a more excellent way.</hi> You are digging and ſearching after Knowledge, as after hid Treaſure; and why not then much more after Grace,
<note place="margin">Luke 16.11.</note> which is the moſt precious and invaluable Treaſure, the only true Riches?
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.23.</note> 
                     <hi>This ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;</hi> as our Saviour ſpeaks in another caſe. Yea, this ye ought much rather to have done, in compariſon whereof your purſuit of knowledge is but as <hi>the tything of mint and cummin, compared with the moſt weighty matters of the law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The more Knowledge you have, the more Grace you need. A little Grace will not ſuffice you to manage a large ſtock of Knowledge. Your Knowledge is one of your chiefeſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents for which you muſt be accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and 'tis impoſſible you ſhould ſo imploy it, as to be able to give a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable account thereof without a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable

                  <p n="3">3. Unleſs you have grace together with your knowledge, the time will come, when you ſhall wiſh that you had been as ignorant, as you are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. <hi>Quàm neſcirem literas! How could I wiſh that I had never learnt to write or read,</hi> was the mild and compaſſionate Speech of an Emperor, when he was deſired to ſet his Hand for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Malefactor.

You may have heard of a poor Idiot, who having never utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one ſerious word before, was heard to utter this ſhort and pertinent Petition, when he was going out of the World, <hi>Lord, require no more of me than thou haſt given me.</hi> The ungodly knowing man, the profane Wit, the learned A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt, will have his mouth ſtopt; he will not be able to find ſo good a Plea for himſelf, as that poor Idiot had. He hath received much from the hand of God, and much ſhall be required of him. And ſo I go on to what followeth in the 20th Verſe.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THE words are a Propoſition ſo clearly and plainly expreſt, that to endeavour to make it plainer were but to loſe time. Seeing therefore I cannot expreſs it in clearer terms, nor caſt it into a better form, I ſhall even take it as it lyes, and ſo handle it; <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that doth evil hateth the light.</hi> The Truth of which Propoſition I know not how I can better demonſtrate, than by ſhewing what influence the light hath upon men in reference to ſin; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, how men ſtand affected towards their ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The light, (I mean principally the light of the Goſpel, of which our Saviour here ſpeaks) diſcovers ſin. There is a threefold light which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſin; the light of Nature, the light of the Law, and the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The very light of Nature doth in ſome meaſure diſcover ſin. The
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61506:22"/>
                  <hi>Gentiles who have not the law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>do by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the things contained in the law, their conſciences in the mean while accuſing or excuſing them,</hi> according as their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more or leſs conformable to the dictates of the light of nature in them. This light was full and perfect, as it was at firſt ſet up in man by his Creator; but is by the fall now become weak and imperfect, ſo that in many things it leaves a man at a great loſs. That firſt light repreſented things to man exactly according to their nature, ſo as by the help of it he could clearly and perfectly diſcern between good and evil; but now that Primitive light being in great part extinguiſhed, the weak remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it repreſent good and evil in a dark and obſcure manner, ſo as by this light alone a man ſees many times little better than he who ſaw Men as Trees;
<note place="margin">Mar. 8.24.</note> yea worſe a great deal, taking good for evil, and evil for good; light for darkneſs,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.20.</note> and darkneſs for light, as the Prophet ſpeaks.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The light of the Law of God written, goes further in the diſcovery of ſin, in which reſpect the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the knowledge of ſin to the Law.
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20.</note> The Law exceeds the light of Nature
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61506:22"/>as to the diſcovery of ſin, in a double reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Law diſcovers more ſins than the meer light of Nature could. <hi>I had not known ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> 
                  <hi>unleſs the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> He had not known the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the inward motions to ſin, at leaſt ſuch of them as go before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the will; the <hi>motus primo primi,</hi> as the Schools call them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Law makes a more full and clear diſcovery of thoſe very ſins which were in ſome meaſure known by the light of Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) The light of the Goſpel goes yet further in the diſcovery of ſin, and in ſome reſpects as much exceeds the Law herein, as the Law doth the light of Nature. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The light of the Goſpel, as 'tis far greater and clearer, ſo 'tis of a more piercing and penetrating nature to find out and diſcover ſin, as the Noon-day light looks into many a dark corner, and expoſeth thoſe things to our view which before could not be diſcerned.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61506:23"/>
               <p n="2">2. Goſpel Adminiſtrations are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a more full Effuſion of the Spirit than was ordinarily under the Law. Now one ſpecial part of the Spirits work being to convince of ſin,
<note place="margin">John 16.8.</note> we may well conclude that the Spirit's Diſcovery and Convictions of ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel are more full and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Goſpel furniſheth us with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Glaſſes in which we may behold ſin repreſented to us in a more lively manner than by the Law alone; and this, whether we conſider the filthineſs or the heinouſneſs of ſin. Theſe Glaſſes are the Holineſs, and the Juſtice of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Holineſs of God is ſo diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſet forth in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and in the Life of Chriſt, as never before. Hence it is that the Scripture ſeems ſo to ſpeak of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if God were little known until Chriſt by his Heavenly Doctrine and Holy Converſation revealed him. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>the only begotten Son, who is in the boſom of the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 12.45, 46.</note> 
                  <hi>he hath declared him. He that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me; I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61506:23"/>am come as a light into the world, that whoſoever believeth in me, ſhould not abide in darkneſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11.27</note> 
                  <hi>No man knoweth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle diſcourſing of the Glory and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Evangelical Adminiſtration beyond the Legal, ſaith, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they of old had a vail upon their Hearts, and ſaw things but darkly, <hi>we all with open face as in a glaſs behold the glory of God</hi> in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. And that he there chiefly intends the Glory of his Holineſs, we may collect from what followeth; and we <hi>are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Now contraries affording mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al light to one another, the more we diſcern of the Holineſs of God, the more filthy and loathſome will ſin appear to us. This we ſee exemplified in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 6.3, 5.</note> who when he had ſeen the Lord ſitting upon his Throne, and heard his Holineſs proclaimed by one of the Seraphims, crying, <hi>Holy, holy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Lord of Hoſts, the whole earth is full of his glory;</hi> in the ſenſe of his ſinfulneſs, he cries out, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61506:24"/>
               <p n="2">2. Another Glaſs to behold ſin in, is the Juſtice and Severity of God againſt ſin. As the Holineſs of God ſhews us the filthineſs of ſin, ſo doth his Juſtice and Severity ſhew us the Heinouſneſs and abominable nature of it. But now the Juſtice and Severity of God againſt ſin was never ſo much diſcovered by all the dreadful Threatnings of the Law, and terrible Judgments that have been inflicted upon Sinners ever ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to this day, nor will ever be ſo much diſcovered by all the Sufferings of Millions in Hell to Eternity, as by what God for our ſins hath laid upon his own Eternal and moſt dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, who is over all God bleſſed for ever. The reaſon hereof is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and undeniable; for the Creature will never be able fully to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God by its endleſs Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Hell; if it could, why might it not be releaſed, and let out of Priſon? But Chriſt hath made full ſatisfaction to his Father's Juſtice; ſo that we have in that ſatisfaction which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his Father, in that ſatisfaction of infinite value, and in that alone, an exact and adequate meaſure by which we may take the full dimenſions of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61506:24"/>heinouſneſs of Man's ſin. Indeed what higher thing is imaginable by which we might be led to the ſight of the heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, than that unparallel'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the moſt Righteous Judge of all the Earth againſt it, which induced him to lay ſuch a weight of puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his only begotten Son, who is of the ſame Divine Eſſence with himſelf, when having taken our Nature on him, he undertook to bear what was due to us for our ſins. By what hath been ſaid, we ſee that the Goſpel not only diſcovers ſin, but alſo doth it in a very ſignal way, making ſuch lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the filthineſs and heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, as neither the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor the Law of God; nor all the dreadful Examples of God's Juſtice and Severity that ever have been, or ever ſhall be, can make.</p>
               <p>Let us now in the next place add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, That men are naturally moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſee their ſins, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of them; and then it may be preſumed we will eaſily grant, that the light muſt in that reſpect be very unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to them. Such is every man's natural Pride and Self-love, that he hath no mind to know how bad he is. He
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61506:25"/>is willing, if it be poſſible, to ſhut his Eyes againſt his own deformities, that he may be able to hold up a good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf. Beſides, as men deſire not to know too much of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, ſo they would not have them known to others. Seeing therefore the ſame light that diſcovers them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, doth alſo lay them open to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; it is a thing not at all ſtrange, that men, as long as they are wicked, and indulge themſelves in ſin, ſhould be no great Friends to the light. It concerns thoſe who have bad Wares, to get them into dark Shops, which may not diſcover the faultineſs of them. And ſo much of that firſt thing, The light, eſpecially that of the Goſpel, makes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of mens ſin, and that is it which they cannot endure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The light of the Goſpel doth not only diſcover mens ſin, but calls upon them to leave it.

                  <hi>And let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> But this is that which the corrupt Heart of man can leaſt of all endure. Men are unwilling to ſee their ſins, but much more unwilling to forſake them. Whence elſe are thoſe excuſes which many frame when they are invited to come unto Chriſt? One is ingaged in this buſineſs, and it muſt be diſpatched; he muſt be diſpenſed with till it be over. Another is inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in that Affair,
<note place="margin">Luke 14.18, 19, 20.</note> and he is not at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Whence elſe are thoſe downright and peremptory Refuſals?
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.40.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have life.</hi> Yea, you would not be gained and prevailed with to come by the largeſt Proffers, by the moſt rich and excellent Promiſes. The greateſt Love and Tenderneſs, the moſt Compaſſionate Solicitations and Importunities, are not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them into a willingneſs; what to do? To be undone? No, to be made for ever; to be gathered under the Wings of Chriſt's moſt tender Care and Love, that they might be everlaſtingly Happy in the Fruition of him. That ſin is the cauſe of this peremptory refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, cannot be denied; for nothing but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61506:26"/>ſin could ſo bewitch and tranſport them, that they ſhould with ſo much obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſtand in their own light, wilfully thruſt away from themſelves Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, and forſake their own Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. 'Tis agreed on, that all men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſire happineſs; 'tis Nature's Language, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 4.6.</note> Could men therefore reject Eternal Happineſs and Glory upon any other Conſideration, than that the Terms on which 'tis offered ſeem to be too hard? They muſt part with their ſins if they will be happy; and O how hard a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this to Fleſh and Blood! The Friendſhip which is between the heart of man and ſin, being ſo ſtrict and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, can that light of the Goſpel be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him whoſe Errand from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is to make an everlaſting ſeparation between him and his ſins? Moſt clear it is, that wicked men, while ſuch, cannot abide the light; and that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may endeavour to cover over their Enmity againſt it with other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, yet the true reaſon why they hate it, is the wickedneſs of their hearts and lives; they therefore hate it becauſe their deeds are evil, as our Saviour gives us an account of the ground of their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred thereof.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:61506:27"/>
               <p>But it may here be objected, That the Holy Scriptures elſewhere ſeem to give other reaſons of mens not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the light of the Goſpel. Sometimes they ſeem to impute it to the ſublimity, and to the myſterious Nature of the great Truths contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Sometimes the Scriptures impute it to the ſubtilty and malice of Satan darkening the minds of men.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>If our goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> And laſtly, otherwhile the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak of God's concealing the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel from ſome men; ſo our Saviour ſpeaking to his Father, ſaith,
<note place="margin">Mat. 11.25</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent.</hi> There being alſo theſe other reaſons of mens not embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the light of the Goſpel, how is it that our Saviour ſeems to lay the whole ſtreſs of this matter upon this, that mens deeds are evil? To this I anſwer,</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61506:27"/>
               <p n="1">1. That it is not neceſſary that we ſhould ſo underſtand our Saviour, as if he intended to make man's ſin the ſole or only cauſe why he hates the light, but one principal cauſe. And that 'tis a principal cauſe thereof, hath already appeared from what hath been ſpoken, and will yet more fully appear by what ſhall be further ſpoken in anſwer to the Objections. Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though there may be ſome other cauſes of mens hating the light, and preferring darkneſs before it; yet they may for the moſt part be ſome way or other reſolved into this which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our here mentioneth. Other things may concur ſometimes, but there is ſcarce any thing that hath ſo general and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſo perpetual an influence upon mens hating, declining, running away from, oppoſing, and rejecting the light, as mans ſin. That moſtly all other cauſes may be reſolved into this, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, in anſwer to the forementioned Objections.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of them, 'tis moſt true, that in Spiritual things there is a great diſproportion between the Intellective Faculty as now 'tis ſince the Fall, and the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61506:28"/>Object. The Myſteries of the Goſpel are high and ſublime; our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is dark, weak, and ſhallow. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whence came this diſproportion? Was it not very much from the ſin of man at firſt, who put out his own Eyes, wounded his Intellectuals, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened his natural Powers? It cannot be denied but that <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Integrity, though he could not have found out thoſe deep Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel concerning our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt, and the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereunto, they being things that have no natural cauſe from whence the higheſt created reaſon might deduce or collect them; and many of them being things above Nature, and ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend meerly upon the good pleaſure of God unknown to us, until by himſelf revealed; I ſay, though <hi>Adam</hi> could not by the ſtrength of his Reaſon and Natural Abilities have found out theſe deep things, yet it cannot be denied but that if theſe things had been propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Adam</hi> to be aſſented to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved upon the Authority of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing them, he both could and would moſt readily have aſſented to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61506:28"/>he had both a power and a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind to believe whatſoever truth God ſhould reveal. And this is all that in theſe matters God requires of us. The deep things of the Goſpel are not propounded to us to be perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and comprehended by us; but they being unfathomable by the longeſt Line of our Reaſon; all that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from us, is, that we give our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them, and believe them; and this only becauſe he who can neither be deceived nor deceive, hath revealed them. But as the caſe now ſtands with us ſince the Fall, though theſe things are moſt clearly revealed, and as ſuch propounded to us, yet we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, they are fooliſhneſs to us, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. So miſerably are our Minds taken up and prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a proud and fond Opinion of our ſelves, of our own natural Ability to judge of theſe things, with falſe Principles, with inveterate Prejudices, and rank Enmity againſt the Truth, and what not? that we ſhut out the light, and forbid it entertainment with us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Add hereunto, that the perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtubbornneſs of the Will, the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61506:29"/>irregularity, the inordinate propenſions, and impetuous motions of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſenſual Appetite, do not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hinder the reception of Spiritual Truths into the Underſtanding. For as bad Meats, as crude and inconcocted Humours in the Stomach, ſend up noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Vapours into the Head, clouding the Mind, diſcompoſing the Brain, and diſturbing the Fancy; ſo the ſinful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, the inordinate Paſſions, the unruly and rebellious diſorders of the inferior Faculties, ſend up ſuch fumes into the higher Region of the Soul, as darken the Underſtanding, as incline and diſpoſe the Mind to embrace what is moſt ſutable to the corrupt bent of the Will and Affections, and to reject the contrary. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s cenſure of young Men as incompetent Auditors of the Precepts of Moral Philoſophy, hath more reaſon in it than at firſt appears. The ſtrength of their Luſts and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doth not only make them unwilling to come under the ſeverity of Moral Precepts in their Practice and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but likewiſe much obſtruct the paſſage of thoſe ſeverer Truths into their Underſtandings. 'Tis no eaſie matter to gain the aſſent of the Underſtanding
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61506:29"/>to thoſe practical Truths which a man hath no mind to be ordered by. Men will be very ingenious to invent, and very facil and eaſie to be prevailed with to entertain reaſons againſt that, which, in reſpect of the contrary byas of their Wills, they would not have to be truth. As 'tis moſt true on the one ſide, <hi>Quod nimis miſeri volumus, hoc facile credimus. A weak and dark Argument ſhall have ſtrength and evidence enough to perſuade us of the truth of that which we have a mind to believe:</hi> So on the other ſide, the moſt clear and demonſtrative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World ſhall not eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, where we are unwilling to be perſuaded.</p>
               <p>Neither is it thus only in matters of Morality, but much more in ſpiritual things, as the corrupt Heart of man is naturally at a far greater remoteneſs and diſtance from them. Upon this ground it ſeems to be that <hi>Solomon,</hi> who could beſt ſpeak to that Argument, tells us, <hi>That the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.7.</note> When a man's heart is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with the fear of God, and in ſome meaſure purged from corrupt Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; when 'tis ſubdued unto God,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61506:30"/>and made yielding and pliable to his Will, then is a man fit to receive the Law from his mouth, and then is the Heart a meet Veſſel to receive the rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable treaſure of heavenly Wiſdom. And ſo much in anſwer to the firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>I go on to the ſecond, That our not entertaining the light, ſeems to be put upon <hi>Satan</hi>'s ſcore. And here, though <hi>Satan</hi>'s malice and guilt be nothing the leſs, 'tis apparent that this cauſe may alſo in great part be reſolved into man's ſin and wickedneſs. How comes it to paſs, that <hi>Satan</hi> hath ſuch advantage againſt man in this matter? whence is it that he can ſo eaſily befool men, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice them againſt the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, keep them in darkneſs, and lead them blindfold to Hell, as the Prophet led the Army of the <hi>Syrians</hi> into <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria?</hi> Is it not becauſe he finds them preingaged in ſinful Courſes, from which they cannot endure to be taken off? Is it not becauſe he finds them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to comply with their Luſts, and corrupt Affections, the gratifying of which is not to be gainſayed, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear it? were it not that he finds in mens hearts ſuch fit matter to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61506:30"/>laid in before, and prepared to his hands, he could not ſo eaſily delude and blind them to their ruine. <hi>Satan</hi> had as much malice againſt Chriſt, and did with the greateſt rage and violence aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him, and endeavour to break in upon him: but he could not do it, as finding nothing within to bid him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 14.31.</note> ſaith he, <hi>and findeth nothing in me. Nihil ſui operis ſuique veſtigii,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Algaſia;</hi> nothing of his own Work, no impreſſions which he himſelf hath made, no footſteps which he himſelf hath left behind him; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all on which to ground an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, or to faſten a Temptation. The words may comprehend both, tho indeed the former ſeems to be in that place chiefly intended. Let <hi>Satan</hi> come to any of us when he will, he is ſure to find ſomething of his own, ſomething of his own work, ſomething of his own image which he hath ſtampt upon us, ſomething that he may lay claim to as his, ſomething of his party that will own him, and ſide with him. Hence the different iſſue of Chriſt's Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ours. When <hi>Satan</hi> came to aſſault him, he found his Soul as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61506:31"/>Caſtle, well fortified on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarter: clear and heavenly light without any mixture of darkneſs in the Underſtanding, perfect holineſs in the Will, exact regularity and compoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Affections; all of one accord within, to make reſiſtance, ſo as it was impoſſible for him to get poſſeſſion. When he comes to us, he finds the Soul as a <hi>city that is broken down,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 25.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and without walls,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks. And he finds a treacherous party within, that is ready to invite him, that would gladly ſet open the Gates to him, and betray all into his hands, were the Soul otherwiſe never ſo well fortified. And thus we ſee how far all the miſchief that <hi>Satan</hi> doth us, may be reſolved into our own ſin. 'Tis true, he blinds us, but 'tis becauſe we have no mind to ſee; he cloſeth our eyes againſt the light of the Goſpel, but he finds us endeavouring to cloſe our own eyes, and glad of any aſſiſtance from him to do it more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. In a word, he ſhuts out the light, that it ſhine not in upon us to our conviction, humiliation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but he makes him ſhuttings to do it, of our own darkneſs, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, falſe Principles, and corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61506:31"/>
               <p>I now proceed to the third Objection taken from <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.25. where God himſelf is ſaid to hide the Myſteries of his Goſpel from the wiſe and prudent. Before I ſay any thing to this Objection, I muſt premiſe, That God in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as in other things) hath a Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive which he makes uſe of, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which he acts, where, and when he ſees good. He being the Supream Lord of Heaven and Earth, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſtyles him in the place whence this Objection is taken, may diſpoſe of the knowledge of the Myſteries of his Kingdom as he pleaſeth, freely vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing it to ſome, and withholding it from others. For what can reſtrain him, but that he may do with his own as he pleaſeth?
<note place="margin">Matth. 20.15.</note> as in the perſon of the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder he argues. This good pleaſure of God is it into which our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly reſolveth his hiding the Myſteries of the Goſpel from the wiſe and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them unto babes; even ſo father, for ſo it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good in thy ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, reſerving unto God his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, I anſwer, That yet however God's hiding the Myſteries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61506:32"/>from men, may very much, and in many caſes, though not univerſally, be reſolved into the ſins of men. For whereas there are chiefly three ways by which God may be ſaid to hide the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel from men; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by denying to them, or removing from them the means of knowledge; or by with-holding the effectual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and operation of his Spirit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the means; or by permitting <hi>Satan</hi> to blind them: upon conſideration of the matter we ſhall find, That the ſins of men have frequently very much to do therein, and contribute much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it; though even here the good pleaſure of God muſt alſo be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legded, who permits it ſo to be, and doth not powerfully interpoſe to hinder it, as he might do if he ſaw good.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God deny the Goſpel to men, 'tis often through their thruſting it away, and keeping it off from themſelves, when 'tis approaching towards them. How often do men oppoſe themſelves againſt it! How often do men decline the light, and chuſe to live in places of darkneſs, where there are no means, or as good as no means of knowledge! So
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61506:32"/>if God remove the Goſpel from a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is it not moſt commonly not only for their own ſin, but by their ſin that 'tis removed? God for their unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unthankfulneſs, for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold ſins againſt the Goſpel, moſt righteouſly gives them up to be active and inſtrumental themſelves in putting out the light, and ſending the Goſpel far away from themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God, continuing the Goſpel, and the means of grace to a People, with-hold the powerful influences and co-operation of his Spirit, what is this in effect, but a leaving them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuffering their luſts, prejudices, love of ſin, and hatred of holineſs, ſo far to prevail in them, as to ſhut and bar up the Soul, and forcibly to keep out the light, or ſo far to weaken the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and impreſſions of it, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe is done upon them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God hide the Myſteries of his Kingdom from them by giving them up to <hi>Satan</hi> to be blinded and deluded by him, the thing is ſtill upon the matter one and the ſame; for as hath been at large ſhewed, <hi>Satan</hi> effects his purpoſe much by their own ſin, and makes uſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61506:33"/>of their Corruptions as the Weapons of his warfare againſt the Soul, to keep it under the power of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Now to apply what hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61506:33"/>of Controverſies, not admitting the Scriptures to be the common Umpire and Determiner of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of their ſhutting up the Book of the Holy Scriptures, and forbidding it to be read by the People, ſo taking away from them the key of Knowledge.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61506:34"/>the extream danger of their preſent condition, the abſolute and indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity of Regeneration, of ſincere and univerſal Repentance, of ſound Converſion, in order to Salvation; if a man ſhall diſcourſe of our natural prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to flatter and deceive our ſelves in theſe important matters, of our utter unwillingneſs to know the worſt of our ſelves, and to be truly acquainted with the ſtate of our Souls; of the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of them that periſh; of the great multitude of them that reſt in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for malities of Religion, and never go further, and of ſuch as have a name to live, but are dead; I ſay, if any man ſhall diſcourſe of theſe things, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable and diſpleaſing, how irkſome and tedious would it be to many of his Hearers! How would they long to be rid of ſuch a man! hardly forbearing to ſay of him, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did of <hi>Michaiah, I have this man; becauſe he never propheſied good of me, but evil.</hi> For ſuch plain dealing, a man perhaps might be treated as kindly by ſome, as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> was by <hi>Amaziah, Go, flee away,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and propheſy there; but propheſy

                  <p>This may alſo acquaint us with the reaſon why many vicious and ungodly People come ſo ſeldom to this place. Their Deeds are evil, their Works are the Works of darkneſs, and therefore they hate the light. A woful Snare, a ſad Intanglement it is in which they are! They hate the light, and come not to it, becauſe their deeds are evil; and yet as long as they come not to the light, they are never likely to be better. But do theſe People think all is well, while withdrawing themſelves from the light, they can make a ſhift to avoid the ſight of their ſin and miſery, and keep their Conſciences aſleep? Let them not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves; the time is coming, when the light will break in upon them, do they what they can to keep it out; <hi>When God will open their eyes, and ſet their ſins in order before them,</hi> as he

Though I have ſmall hopes that I ſhall be able to ſay any thing that may work upon people ſo much eſtranged from God, and ſo miſerably hardened in their ſins; yet over, and above what hath been ſaid, I ſhall recommend theſe two things to the ſerious conſideration of ſuch perſons, if any of them be at preſent here; for tho we have little of their company here, yet I know not, but that ſome of them may now and then have the curioſity, though not the Religion, to look within theſe Doors, and drop in amongſt us.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words we have a ſhort, but very ſatisfactory account of the Ground of God's ſevere proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> for their ſins. God had long born with them, he had uſed all ſorts of means to reclaim them: He had ſometimes been drawing them by the Cords of a Man, with Bands of Love; he had been trying to win them by kindneſs;
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 11.4.</note> he <hi>was to them as they that take off the yoke on their Jaws, and he laid meat unto them.</hi> He had
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61506:39"/>treated them with that gentleneſs and kindneſs which is wont to work upon Irrational Creatures, and make the very brute Beaſts, tame, gentle, and tractable;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>For even the Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his maſters crib.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhile he had been trying whether ſeverity might take any better effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; he had been correcting them firſt more favourably, and with much lenity, afterwards more ſharply and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely; and together with other means, he had been ſtill warning, admoniſhing, exhorting, reproving, threatning them by his Prophets, and ſetting before them the Comforts and Rewards of Repentance and Obedience, and the ſad conſequents and iſſues of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, in caſe they ſhould ſtill go on in their Sin and Impenitency. But none of theſe things would work upon them; through long cuſtom and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in ſin, they were now become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible; 'twas in vain to expect that they ſhould be reformed: All means and endeavours were but loſt upon them. Wherefore ſeeing their Diſeaſe appeared to be incurable, God was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be rid of them, and to eaſe himſelf of them once for all. They
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61506:39"/>ſhould dwell in his Land no longer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they muſt into Captivity, and ſuch a Captivity as ſhould not only remove them far from the Land of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, but ſcatter them up and down, and diſperſe them from one another. So we have their Sin and Puniſhment ſet forth in the words of the Text, and the following Verſe; <hi>Can the Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good, that are accuſtomed to do evil. Therefore will I ſcatter them as the ſtubble that paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the wind of the wilderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to the words, we may by the way obſerve, That 'tis a moſt woful condition to be ſtill incorrigible under all means applyed to humble and reform us. The miſery of ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lyes in theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God is wont to give up ſuch a people to themſelves, to walk in the way of their own Hearts. He ſaith of them, as of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.5.</note> 
               <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? Ye will revolt more and more;</hi> and as of <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.17.</note> 
               <hi>Ephraim is joined to Idols, let him alone;</hi> he is ſo nearly joined, and intirely united to them in his Affections, that nothing
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61506:40"/>will withdraw him from them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let him alone, let him take his courſe, and ſee what will come of it in the end. And though this may ſeem to be no great evil, but rather an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and a very deſirable liberty in the Judgment of the Sinner, who cannot endure to be curbed or reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet 'tis a very heavy Judgment, and ſo much worſe than any Affliction whatſoever, as the evil of ſin is worſe than the evil of puniſhment. And ſo God ſpeaks of this his Diſpenſation in words full of high Indignation and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me; ſo I gave them up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I met with them, and was avenged of them for their wretched contempt of me; I let them go on, and ſuffered them to be as vicious and profligate, as filthy and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable, as they had a mind to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing in which lyes the Miſery of an incorrigible people is, that they are now ripe for Ruin, or for ſome terrible Judgment. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> (ſaid God to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) that is,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61506:40"/>Becauſe I uſed all fit means to purge and reform thee, and yet ſtill thou wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in thy filthineſs and lewdneſs, thou art incorrigible;
<note place="margin">Ezek. 24.13. Prov. 29.1</note> 
               <hi>therefore thou ſhalt not be purged from thy filthineſs till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 29.1</note> 
               <hi>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy.</hi> An incorrigible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom no reproofs will work upon, is next door to deſtruction, to una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable deſtruction, if ſtill he go on; he <hi>ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy;</hi> nothing ſhall plead for him, or interpoſe in his behalf to reſcue him from deſtruction. In the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.14, 15, 16, 17. God by the Penman of that Book ſets forth the great ſins of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the means he was pleaſed to make uſe of to reduce them to obedience, their incorrigibleneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe means; and laſtly, the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Judgments which thereupon he brought upon them. All the chief of the Prieſts and the People tranſgreſſed very much, after the Abominations of the Heathen, and polluted the Houſe of the Lord which he had hallowed in <hi>Jeruſalem: And the Lord God of their fathers ſent to them by his meſſengers,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61506:41"/>riſing up betimes, and ſending, becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling-place; but they mocked the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of God aroſe againſt his people, till there was no remedy;</hi> and what was at length the iſſue of this their incorrigibleneſs and ſtubbornneſs? That follows in the next words; <hi>therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who ſlew their young men with the ſword in the houſe of their ſanctuary, and had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that ſtooped for age.</hi> And as the incorrigibleneſs of this ſtubborn and ſtiff-necked people brought the <hi>Chaldees</hi> upon them; ſo afterwards the like incorrigibleneſs brought the <hi>Romans</hi> upon their Poſterity, to their utter ruin and final deſolation; for 'tis their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigibleneſs that our Saviour makes the fore-runner and cauſe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 23.37, 38.</note> 
               <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee: how often would I have gathered thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together within thee, even as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not; therefore your houſe is
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61506:41"/>left unto you deſolate.</hi> Take notice of this, and lay it to heart all you that have been often reproved for your ſins, and yet you ſtill harden your Necks; unto whom many ſeaſonable Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and wholeſome Counſels and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices have been tender'd, but you have ſtopt your Ears againſt them; who have often ſmarted for your ſins, and yet you love them ſtill, and delight in them as much as ever you did; you that have been often in the Furnace of Affliction, and yet your Droſs is not ſeparated from you; I ſay, take notice of the woful condition of incorrigible Sinners, and conſider what awaits you, and will certainly be your portion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by Repentance you ſpeedily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>

<note place="margin">2 Chron. 25.16.</note> 
               <hi>By this I know that God hath determined to deſtroy thee, becauſe thou haſt not hearkened to my counſel.</hi> I do not ſay God hath determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you alſo, I take not upon me to be ſo well acquainted with God's ſecret purpoſes; but this I ſay, you are at preſent in the high-way to deſtruction, and you have great cauſe to fear leſt God deſtroy you, as he hath done by other ſuch incorrigible perſons as you are. If you ſtill continue to be like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have been deſtroyed for the ſame ſins, what reaſon have you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect more favour than they had? God is not changed, he is ſtill the ſame, his hatred of ſin, his juſtice and ſeverity againſt Sin, is ſtill as great as ever it was.</p>
            <p>And ſo much concerning that Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I come now to that which I chiefly intended. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots?</hi> That is, they cannot; no Art or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour can effect it. Waſh and rub the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61506:43"/>Skin of the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> while you will, it will retain its natural hew; you may ſooner rub away the Skin, than alter the colour of it: and ſo for thoſe ſpots with which Nature hath mark'd the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, you may by much tampering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſubject of them, but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject remaining, you can never get out the ſpots. And little leſs difficulty there is in removing thoſe habitual Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to ſin, which long cuſtom hath produced: The caſe is much alike, to waſh a Blackamoor white, and to get him to do good that is accuſtomed to do evil. So then 'tis a Proverbial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, by which is ſignified the extream difficulty of delivering a Man from thoſe vicious impreſſions which cuſtom in ſin hath made upon him. And that's the thing which I purpoſe to treat of.</p>
            <p>Cuſtom in ſin makes it very difficult to leave ſin. There needs little other proof hereof than our own Experience. Though ſome vicious Perſons, who are taken in hand, and dealt with betimes, may be more eaſily drawn off from their ſinful courſes, yet how rare a thing is it to ſee any man recovered, who hath long been exerciſed in a trade of ſin! Shall you eaſily prevail with the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61506:43"/>intemperate, or luſtful, or ambitious, or covetous perſon, to leave thoſe paths of ſin which have been long trodden by them? So great is the force of cuſtom in ſin, that men will by no Arguments be perſwaded to forſake thoſe long-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſinful practices, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually attended with ſo many viſible and great inconveniences, as one would think were ſufficient to make any man weary of ſuch courſes.</p>
            <p>Take for an inſtance but a wandring Beggar, that neceſſarily undergoes many hardſhips, and runs many hazards in that irregular and wicked courſe of life which he hath been wonted to, and you ſhall in vain tempt him to leave it by the beſt proviſions and accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which you can proffer him in any ſetled way of honeſt Imployment.</p>
            <p>Or take a nearer inſtance in the ſame kind; When almoſt do you ever ſee one of our poor people whoſe hands refuſe to labour, and who make a trade of begging from Door to Door; I ſay, when almoſt do you ſee any ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reclaimed, and brought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get his Living in any honeſt and laborious Calling? I deny not, but 'tis poſſible there maybe inſtances of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61506:44"/>ſome ſuch that have been reduced to an orderly courſe of life; but I believe ſuch inſtances are very rare, eſpecially of thoſe who have from their Childhood been addicted to that diſorderly courſe, as too many are; the only Breeding and Education which their Parents give them, being to teach them how to eat the Bread of idleneſs, and live upon the Charity of others, if that may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Charity which is beſtowed upon ſuch people.</p>
            <p>The grounds of this point are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Cuſtom begets a ſtrong, fixed and habitual Inclination to ſin. Hence a Man is ever in a readineſs to yield to, and comply with any Temptation to that ſin unto which he hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed. No ſooner is occaſion offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but it meets with a preparation of heart to embrace it. Inſtead of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to reſiſt Temptations when they begin to approach, and offer themſelves, he that hath been accuſtomed to ſin, will meet them half way, invite them to come on, and bid them welcome; inſtead of declining Temptations, he will ſeek after them, and ſtudiouſly make proviſion for his Luſts. For cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61506:44"/>is now become another Nature to him, and he ſeems to enjoy himſelf no longer than he is complying with it. To be divorc'd and ſeparated from ſuch ſins, is a moſt grievous thing; 'tis as the pulling out of a right Eye, or the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off of a right Hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Cuſtom in ſin brings on delight in ſin; the actions that are natural, are moſtly accompanied with ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: And ſo are ſinful actions, when cuſtom hath made them familiar to us, and given them, as it were, the ſtamp of Nature. 'Tis ſtrange that a Man ſhould be ſenſible of any pleaſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light at all in ſome ſins; and yet through cuſtom there is that content and complacency in them, that it is as death to forſake them. To ſit in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Ale-houſe, and to be continually pouring in that which to a ſober Man would be little better than a Potion; to ſpend days and nights in a dark hole amidſt the ſtink of Vomits and Spew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings round about, to the blaſting of a Man's Reputation, the impairing of his Health, the miſ-ſpending of his time, and the waſting away of that which it may be Wife and Children want at home; who would think there ſhould
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61506:45"/>be any content in ſuch a Life? And yet there are, who by cuſtom have made it ſo pleaſurable to them, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it before all the contents and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions that a fair Houſe, a Table rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpread, and the Society of their neareſt Relations can afford them, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other advantages and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might render their converſe at home comfortable and delightſom. If cuſtom hath once made ſuch baſe and dirty ways of ſin pleaſant, you ſhall in vain tempt them out of them, or indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to draw them off from them by the faireſt and moſt taking proffers that you can make them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Cuſtom in ſin blinds the mind, and corrupts the judgment, ſo that a man ceaſeth to be a competent judge of the nature of things, and of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between good and evil. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees he is beſotted, and comes to be in great meaſure deprived of the reaſon of a man; ſo far hath ſin darkened his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and weakened his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals for judging of Spiritual things. He is given up <hi>to a reprobate mind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.28.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; he puts good for evil, and evil for good; light for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and darkneſs for light. And
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61506:45"/>when the light of reaſon is darkened, and the Eye of the Soul is put out; when the leading and governing Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul is thus depraved, it muſt needs be a difficult thing to draw a man off from thoſe ways, the evil whereof he cannot diſcern, nor will be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Cuſtom in ſin ſeareth the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and draws ſuch a callus or braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nineſs over it, as it becomes inſenſible. At firſt there is ſome tenderneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſome reluctancy, and ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from thoſe ſins which after a frequent repetition and cuſtomary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them, a man makes no bones of, but ſmoothly ſwallows down. He that at firſt durſt not tell a Lie, or if he were at any time overtaken, was wont to be much troubled afterwards; yet upon a cuſtomary practice of that ſin, will add Lies to Lies, and ſtand to them moſt impudently and obſtinately: He that ſeemed to fear an Oath, will through cuſtomary Swearing arrive at that degree of inſenſibleneſs, that he will not ſtick to multiply Oaths, and Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries alſo, if need be, and all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any touch of remorſe, any gainſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or grudgings of his Conſcience.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61506:46"/>Now when a Man through cuſtom in ſin comes to that paſs, that his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is quiet, and doth not either inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe before the commiſſion of ſin to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, or moleſt him, and diſturb his peace afterwards, 'twill be no eaſie matter to diſengage him from that ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Cuſtom in ſin doth conſequently harden the heart againſt all means by which the Sinner ſhould be reclaimed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It hardens the heart againſt the Word. The threatnings thereof, and all the moſt dreadful denunciations of Judgments, make no impreſſion upon ſuch a Mans heart; 'tis as Steel or Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant that will not yield or relent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither will the wholeſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Advices or Admonitions of Friends and Chriſtian Acquaintance work upon it. He hath no ſenſe of any thing which in that way is offered him for his good: His Ears are ſtopt againſt the voice of the Charmer, Charm he never ſo wiſely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He is fortified with Armour of proof againſt all Providences, by which he might be ſtopt in his courſe of ſin, or reduced from the Errour of his ways. Let God oppoſe him in his ſinful courſe,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61506:46"/>let him hedge up his ways with Thorns, or ſtand before him with a drawn Sword, all is one, on he will fearleſly and preſumptuouſly, and adventure himſelf upon the thick Boſſes of his Buckler, in <hi>Job</hi>'s phraſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Cuſtom in Sin emboldens Satan to tempt. Where the Conſcience is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Heart is ſenſible of the evil, and danger of Sin, and where he hath been formerly reſiſted and repelled, there if he tempt, yet he doth it with leſs confidence of prevailing, and with ſome degree of Cowardly Expectation of being worſted; but where he hath to do with thoſe who have been long accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to the Sin he would again draw them into, he makes little queſtion of prevailing, as knowing well the ſeared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Conſciences, the hardneſs of their Hearts, and their ſtrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions to the ſin unto which he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to tempt them; as alſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring how often his Temptations in the ſame kind have already been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p n="7">7. By Cuſtom in ſin God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to leave a Man to himſelf, to the power of Satan, and the efficacy of Temptation; and in way of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61506:47"/>Judgment to give him up to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of impenitency and hardneſs of heart.</p>

               <p>This diſcovers the folly and danger of deferring Repentance, and eſpecially of putting it off till the time of Sickneſs, or till our Deathbed. The longer we defer Repentance, the more difficult will the buſineſs be, through ſo long cuſtom in Sin. If you find it hard at preſent to think of leaving your Sins, what will it be hereafter when they will have taken deeper root in you, and when your habitual Inclinations to them will be ſtronger? And as for putting off Repentance till the time of Sickneſs or Death; what wiſe Man would put off a work of the greateſt Importance, and the moſt difficult work, and a work that will be ſtill more difficult every day the longer 'tis put off; I ſay, what wiſe Man would put off ſuch a work till that time, when he will be weakeſt and moſt unable to undertake it, and go thorough with it?

And this yet once more he preſſeth them unto in the words of my Text; <hi>See then that ye walk circumſpectly:</hi> that is, Being now no longer in darkneſs, but in the light, Take heed that you indulge not your ſelves in thoſe ſins, and in that ſinful li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which formerly you did, when as yet the light of the Goſpel had not been afforded you. Then you led your lives as you pleaſed, following the dictates of your dark Underſtandings, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt inclinations of your ſinful Natures; but now better things are expected from you. This ſeems to be the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words with the Apoſtle's for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſe; but I ſhall not take any notice of what might be obſerved from the coherence, but keep my ſelf to the words abſolutely conſidered, without any reflection upon the dependance of them. In the words we have,</p>
            <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61506:54"/>
            <p n="1">1. A great and weighty Duty ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoined; <hi>See that ye walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. An Argument by which the Duty is enforced; an Argument at leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in thoſe words, <hi>not as fools, but as wiſe.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly,</hi> becauſe 'tis our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſo to walk, and our folly if we do not.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Of all theſe in order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing to be ſpoken to, is, The Duty enjoined; <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly.</hi> So then, the point to be treated of, is, That 'tis our duty to walk circumſpectly.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing of this point, I ſhall</p>

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt ſhew what it is not, and then what it is. Negatively then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The circumſpect walking here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, doth not lie in an affected ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity; as when a man walks contrary to other men, with no other deſign, nor to no other end, than that he may not be like them, but be a perſon alone, and one by himſelf. God never calls us to this ſeparation from the World: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath this been the practice of holy men, whoſe Example is in Scripture ſet before us for our imitation. S. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his condeſcenſion to men, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them in all lawful things, that he might win them to Chriſt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Jews I became as a Jew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor 9.20, 21, 22.</note> ſaith he, <hi>that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all things to all men,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:61506:55"/>that I might by all means ſave ſome.</hi> How far was he from ſtudying to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to other men, who thus ſtudied to apply himſelf to all men, and conform himſelf to them, ſo far as without ſin he might do it! Yet here, let no man abuſe this Example of the Apoſtle, and plead it for juſtifying his conforming himſelf to the ſinful practices of every Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he lights on. The Apoſtle never gave any man ſuch Example. This had been contrary to his own Doctrine, who chargeth us <hi>not to conform our ſelves to this world.</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note> to this wicked and ſinful World, ſo far as ſuch; And to <hi>abhor that which is evil;</hi> Yea,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.9. 1 Theſſ. 5.22.</note> 
               <hi>to abſtain from all appearance of evil.</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to go as far away from other men as we can, and to ſtudy to be oppoſite to them in thoſe things in which we may lawfully conform to them, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially where we may hope to do any good by our innocent compliance with them, is a ſingularity which God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther requireth of us, nor approves of. The root of this affected ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as we have moſt reaſon to fear, is Pride. 'Tis a manifeſt conceit, and good opinion of his own wiſdom, that makes him chuſe a way different from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61506:56"/>other men. And as the root, ſo the fruit of it is pride: For being now in this ſingular way which his ſelf-conceit hath put him into, he pleaſeth himſelf therein, and values himſelf accordingly, making account that he is ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other men, by how much his practice is different from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Circumſpect walking doth not lie in a ſuperſtitious ſingularity, whereby a man placeth Duty and Religion in thoſe things in which God hath placed none. This was the ſin of the old <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> who <hi>taught for doctrines the commandments of men;</hi> that is, for Divine Doctrines, for the Precepts and Injunctions of God. And this is the ſin of the Modern <hi>Phariſees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 15.9.</note> thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who tread in their ſteps: And ſuch, I fear, is the ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thoſe among our ſelves, whom we call <hi>Quakers.</hi> Though theſe Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Singularities may gain men a great reputation for Religion and Sanctity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men of their own Party, as do the different Habits, Diet, courſe of life, uſages, and practices of the ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet can they never commend them to God. Of all theſe ſuperſtitious Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61506:56"/>by which they would ſeparate and diſtinguiſh themſelves from the Secular and Irreligious World, in which they pride themſelves as matters highly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and meritorious in the ſight of God, and for which others of their own way admire, and even adore them; I ſay of all theſe things God ſaith, <hi>Who hath required them at your hands?</hi> That's all the thanks they muſt expect of him for them. Neither is this all; he looks upon their placing Religion and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thoſe things in which he hath placed none, as a bold and ſaucy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment upon his own Authority and Prerogative. And indeed, what is it better, when Men ſhall take upon them to be Legiſlators in God's room, making thoſe things to be Sins and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he never made ſo? Moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere is the threatning againſt ſuch as add to the Word of God, which in effect theſe Men do;
<note place="margin">Rev. 22.18.</note> 
               <hi>God will add unto them the plagues that are written therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Circumſpect walking doth not conſiſt in a ſcrupulous ſingularity. I diſtinguiſh this from the former; that is the ſingularity of bold and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Perſons; this of weak, and not ſufficiently-informed tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61506:57"/>that call for our Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions, rather than our Indignation, foraſmuch as they would be glad to be better informed, and differ from the lawful practice of other Men conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, and to no other end than that they might not offend God, as they groundleſly and erroneouſly apprehend they might. Though no Man's Error commends him unto God, yet his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage under an Error may; and this is the caſe of theſe Perſons. And it was the very caſe of thoſe Conſcientious, though miſtaken, <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Believers at <hi>Rome,</hi> who not out of perverſeneſs or turbulent oppoſition, but out of pure diſſatisfaction in point of Conſcience, did ſtill obſerve thoſe days, the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof God then no longer requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and ſtill forbear to eat thoſe Meats which God then permitted to be eaten. Of thoſe weak and miſtaken Believers the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.6.</note> 
               <hi>He that regardeth a day, regardeth it to the Lord; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not.</hi> His meaning is, That doing what they did out of Conſcience, though miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they (as their preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was) did well, and ſo far had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God. But ſtill I ſay,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61506:57"/>though there may be ſomething that is good in a Man's not adventuring to go againſt the dictates of an Erroneous Conſcience, namely, a fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God if he ſhould do otherwiſe than he doth, yet the circumſpect walking here enjoined conſiſts not in ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity; which being grounded on a miſtake, a Man is bound to endeavour to be rid of it, and to be delivered from it as ſoon as he can. And the rather, becauſe as the Circumſtances may be in which a Man is, it may be moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and pernicious to lye under his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and continue in his Errour but one day or hour: For the Errour may be ſuch as may put him upon deſperate Attempts, or horrid Sins. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, there would be thoſe who would think they did God ſervice by killing his Servants.
<note place="margin">Joh. 16.2.</note> A Man's Errour may be ſuch as may not only deprive him of ſome of thoſe Liberties which he might lawfully take, but they may ingage him in a conſtant neglect of his Duty, or oppoſition to that lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which God hath ſet over him. In theſe and the like caſes a Mans mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake or miſinformation will not excuſe him before God, when he ſhall call him to an account.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:61506:58"/>
            <p>And ſo much may ſuffice to have been ſpoken of circumſpect walking ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively; it now follows that I ſpeak of it affirmatively. To walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a large and comprehenſive thing. Walking takes in the whole courſe of a Mans Life, our whole carriage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment both with relation to God and Man.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here uſed, may be rendred, accurately or exactly; and ſo to walk requires great heed and diligence. So the ſame word is taken,
<note place="margin">Mat. 2.8.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, he diligently or exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquired the time when the Star ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61506:58"/>Briefly therefore, to walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly is to uſe our utmoſt care and diligence to pleaſe God in all things, and to yield obedience to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; to perform every known Duty, and to avoid every known ſin; 'tis with the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Act. 24.16</note> 
               <hi>Herein to exerciſe our ſelves to have always a Conſcience void of offence toward God and toward men.</hi> 'Tis to make this our daily work, and the great and conſtant buſineſs of our Lives.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that circumſpect walking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,</p>
            <p n="1">1. An heeding and obſerving all our ways with relation to the Rule; and,</p>
            <p n="2">2. A careful endeavour in all things to conform our ſelves to the Rule; ſo that he, and he only walks circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who hath the Rule always before him, ponders and conſiders all his paths with relation to it, and orders all his ſteps accordingly, at leaſt who ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavours ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Now in the ſecond place, That 'tis our Duty to walk circumſpectly, may be confirmed from divers other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures enjoining it, though not in the ſame terms, yet in other words and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61506:59"/>expreſſions to the ſame effect. When God had given the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the Ten Commandments, and many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws, he addeth this ſtrict charge for the due obſervance of them, <hi>In all things that I have ſaid unto you be circumſpect;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 23.13.</note> which charge though it did in a ſpecial manner concern that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet it reacheth us alſo in reference to whatever God hath enjoined us, there being every way as much reaſon that we ſhould be circumſpect, and in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects more, we having greater light, and clearer revelations of the Will of God under the Goſpel than they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law; as alſo greater Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to obedience by the more full diſcoveries of the Rewards of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the other World. So again, <hi>Take diligent heed to do the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the law.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joſh. 22.5. Joſh. 23.11</note> 
               <hi>Take good heed unto your ſelves that ye love the Lord your God;</hi> which love was to be ſhewed by cleaving to him, and obeying him, as there afterwards it follows.

               <hi>He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity.</hi> Now what heedful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and circumſpection can be too much in all our actions, where there is ſuch an obſerver and witneſs of every thing we do?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt walk circumſpectly in regard of Satan the Enemy of Souls, who is ever lying in wait for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap us,

               <p>Let us all be perſwaded to walk more circumſpectly; to keep a more narrow and conſtant watch over our ſelves, and to take better heed to our ways than we have done. Now though all are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, highly concerned to walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, yet are ſome in a ſpecial manner concerned to do it above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They who in reſpect of their Rank and Quality, their Acquaintance and Alliances, their Callings and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are expoſed to moſt Temptations. They who neceſſarily meet with many Temptations, cannot but often offend, unleſs they be very circumſpect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It concerns them above others to be circumſpect who have formerly moſt
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61506:64"/>offended through their careleſneſs, their heedleſneſs, and their want of more circumſpection. How often have you been overtaken with ſin in one kind or other, which you might eaſily have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, if you had been circumſpect? 'Tis high time for you to reſolve to be more circumſpect for the future, who have already contracted ſo much guilt through your careleſneſs, and eſpecially if you have alſo ſmarted for your care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and regardleſs walking.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It concerns them above others to be circumſpect, who in reſpect of their Places and Stations ought to be Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to others. Theſe are ſo much the more obliged to walk circumſpectly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe elſe they become ill patterns to thoſe whoſe Eyes are upon them, and occaſions of much ſin and guilt to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It behoves them above others to walk circumſpectly who are drawing near the end of their walk; who are not far from their long home, and have little time left them to correct the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Errors of their Life paſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It behoves them above others to walk circumſpectly, who after more ſtrictneſs formerly have for ſome time
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61506:64"/>now laſt paſt taken more liberty, and walked more looſly and careleſly. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) If theſe give not all dilgence to recover themſelves, and regain what they have loſt, they will ſtill grow more remiſs and careleſs.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It would be a very ſad thing if their laſt ways ſhould be their worſt, and if death ſhould ſurprize them in a declining condition.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It behoves them above others to walk circumſpectly, who having been often convinced of the neceſſity and comforts of circumſpect walking, and having often reſolved on it, could never yet put their Reſolutions in practice, or at leaſt with any conſtancy go on therein. The Convictions and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Perſons, as they do much aggravate and heighten their ſin, ſo they will much heighten and inflame their reckoning when God ſhall call them to an account.</p>
               <p>Now in the further proſecution of this Uſe, I ſhall offer ſome Directions for walking circumſpectly; give ſome Cautions about it; and laſtly, anſwer ſuch Objections as may be made againſt it. By way of Direction for walking
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61506:65"/>circumſpectly, I ſhall only mention theſe few things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Keep your heart with all diligence. As the frame of your heart is, ſo for the moſt part are your actions:
<note place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> 
                  <hi>From the heart are the iſſues of life.</hi> Your cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection in the courſe of your Life hath its riſe from your keeping your heart. He that neglects his heart will never be able to order and frame his words and actions according to the rule. Wherefore be ſure that you lay the Foundation of all your circumſpection, in the heeding of your heart, and in keeping it under Government. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern your heart well, and you govern your Tongue, and rule your hand, and the whole Man. Let the heart be once out of order, and the effects of it will ſoon appear in the unrulineſs of the Tongue, and the irregularity of your Actions. Whatſoever elſe is out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be ſure the heart was firſt out of order. O how eaſie a task would it be to order all the reſt, if the heart were well ordered! O let's begin there, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrict and conſtant guard over it.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:61506:65"/>
               <p n="2">2. Set God always before your Eyes, and labour to keep up lively Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Preſence and Omniſcience. How awful and circumſpect would this make you! How ſolicitous would you be of pleaſing him, and how much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of offending him! This conſtant ſenſe of God's preſence, and awe of his All-ſeeing Eye upon our hearts; no man that hath not had ſome Experience of it, can eaſily conceive what an influence it would have upon us to beget in us this holy circumſpection. 'Tis our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfulneſs of God's Eye and Preſence that makes us ſo heedleſs and unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider all your ways, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your paths, as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s counſel is, <hi>Weigh your words and actions in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the ſanctuary,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 4.26.</note> 
                  <hi>examine them by the rule.</hi> But let this be done moſt carefully and exactly when any matter of great and weighty conſequence lies before you. Then be ſure that you do nothing but upon ſound and mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; and upon clear ſatisfaction, that what you do, is agreeable to the rule, and ſuitable to the principles of good conſcience. How often doth mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy and raſhneſs hurry them into
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61506:66"/>thoſe ſins, which afterwards occaſion much anguiſh and horror of Conſcience to them. So what is raſhly done in a quarter of an hour, lies grating upon their Conſciences many years after; it may be they are never fully eaſed of the burthen of it as long as they live.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take heed of being ſwayed and overruled by the judgment and practice of others to a compliance with them in what your own Conſcience is not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to do. The Opinion and Practice of the multitude is a deceitful and crooked Rule. What the generality cry up, approve of, and applaud, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur and agree in, may be extremely evil; what is highly eſteemed among men, may be abomination in the ſight of God.
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.15.</note> And again, What men cry down, and vilify, what they make to be matter of reproach and contumely, that may be in ſuch account with God, as it may be highly accepted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. And yet ſo it is, that we are apt to place very much in the opinion and example of a multitude. What many or moſt do, what the generality of Town and Country do, that we ſtick not to do. Weak Arguments ſhall be ſtrong enough to prevail with us to be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61506:66"/>of the ſtronger ſide, and to concur with the multitude. Wherefore it was not without great cauſe that God gave his People a ſpecial caution againſt this weak and ſinful compliance.
<note place="margin">Exod. 23.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil, neither ſhalt thou ſpeak in a cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline after many to wreſt judgment.</hi> God ſaw our proneneſs to be influenced and ſwayed by the multitude, and to go, <hi>non quà eundum, ſed quà itur, not in that path in which we ſhould go, but in which the greater part go.</hi> If in any thing therefore our circumſpection be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, it is when we are aſſaulted with the temptation to warp and turn aſide out of the right way.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Be careful to keep at a diſtance from all temptations to ſin, as far as you are able. Where you foreſee they are making towards you, avoid them, run away from them: Herein lies a great part of your circumſpection. If you heedleſly and careleſly run upon temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and much more if you wilfully and preſumptuouſly caſt your ſelf upon them, 'tis no hard matter to foretell what the iſſue will be. No man can expect to be ſtrengthened againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to be ſecured againſt the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61506:67"/>malignant influences of them, that is not careful to avoid them as far as he is able; and much leſs may he expect it, that wittingly and deliberately ventures on them. This man doth indeed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke God to leave him to the power of temptation, that he may ſmart for his preſumptuous folly in the end. He, and he only walks ſafely, that walks ſo circumſpectly as not to come too near the borders of ſin and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Above all, take heed of ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements. By ſinful intanglements, I mean any raſh Lies or Engagements to do what may not be done with a good conſcience. When any man is by Oath, or Promiſe, or any other way under an Engagement to do what is ſinful, he is in the Snare of the Devil, out of which 'twill be very difficult to diſintangle himſelf. That were a fearful caſe; and therefore he that loves his own Soul, and conſults his innocency, and the peace of his Conſcience, will be ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as to beware of ſuch intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>So having done with the Directions for walking circumſpectly; I now come in the next place to the Caution
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61506:67"/>relating thereunto; and they are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let not your circumſpection and conſcientiouſneſs degenerate into vain ſcrupuloſity, and needleſs ſingularity: Neither make more ſins, nor more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than the Law of God hath made. That a Perſon of a tender Conſcience may offend this way, both Experience ſhews, and the Caveat of <hi>Solomon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; <hi>Be not righteous overmuch.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.16.</note> 'Tis certain that no man can be too ſtrict or conſcientious, too exact or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in performance of what is really matter of duty: the Wiſeman's mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore is, Be not over-ſcrupulous, placing ſin or duty in thoſe things in which they are not. This groundleſs ſcrupulouſneſs is attended with ſeveral miſchiefs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It often expoſeth men to dangers cauſleſly, and brings thoſe evils upon them, which if they were better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they might without ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſtraitents them, and ties them up more than need is, and deprives them of thoſe lawful Liberties which
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61506:68"/>they might with a good conſcience make uſe of, and enjoy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It makes them apt to judge and cenſure thoſe cauſleſly and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, who lawfully, and with a good conſcience, do thoſe things, which they through miſinformation judge ought not to be done.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If circumſpection ſhould degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into vain and needleſs ſcrupulouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it would bring a reproach upon truly conſcientious ſtrictneſs, and that holy circumſpection which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us Upon theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, let not, I ſay, your circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction degenerate into vain and needleſs ſcrupuloſity, which is the firſt Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In your circumſpect walking, be ſure that you ever lay the greateſt ſtreſs upon the greateſt matters. Take care that you be not like the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 23.24.</note> who <hi>would ſtrain at a gnat, but ſwallow a camel.</hi> Make conſcience of all known Duties, even of the leaſt, of <hi>tithing mint and cummin;</hi> but let your chief care, and moſt ſolicitous circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection be exerciſed about the <hi>weightier matters of the law.</hi> For if while you would ſeem to be very circumſpect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61506:68"/>ſmaller matters, and to make much conſcience of little things, you make no conſcience at all of far greater matters; You hereby</p>
               <p n="1">1. Make evident proof of your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy unto all that obſerve your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You throw dirt upon circumſpect walking, and cauſe the ſtrict and holy ways of God to be misjudged, and evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>So much concerning the 2d Caution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Notwithſtanding your own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſtrictneſs and circumſpection, be not forward to condemn others, who in ſome things may be ſatisfied to do what you cannot. I ſay, be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to condemn their Perſons, much leſs their Eſtate; provided that</p>
               <p n="1">1. They be ſuch as otherwiſe walk unblamably as to the general courſe of their lives.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Provided alſo, that the things in which you are not ſatisfied to do as they do, be not clearly and undeniably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rule. I ſay, theſe things provided, be not forward to condemn
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61506:69"/>them in reſpect of thoſe things in which their practice is different from your own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When you have done all that you can, and framed your life with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt circumſpection and exactneſs that you can poſſibly attain unto, look for your acceptance with God, through Chriſt only, <hi>and count all things,</hi> your beſt things, <hi>loſs and dung in compariſon of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So from the Cautions, I paſs on to the Objections that may be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt circumſpect walking. Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are ſo much for liberty, that this circumſpect walking is not very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them. Many things they have to ſay againſt it; and indeed it were ſtrange, if a courſe of life ſo contrary to our corrupt Inclinations, ſhould not be encountred with many Objections. I ſhall endeavour to ſay ſomething to the chief of them, that ſo the Prejudices that fright men away from circumſpect walking, or poſſeſs their minds with miſpriſions or miſtakes concerning it, being removed, men may be reconciled to it, or at leaſt be perſuaded to make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of it. If they would make trial of it, their own experience would quickly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61506:69"/>undeceive them, and induce them to entertain a better opinion of it. The Objections which I ſhall ſpeak to, are theſe that follow:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Such a ſtrict courſe of life, ſo ſevere and circumſpect a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would deprive men of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life, and plunge them in the depths of ſadneſs and melancholly. God in all his dealings and Providences deſigns our good and comfort; who then can imagine that he ſhould call us unto, and ingage us in ſo mopiſh and monkiſh a way?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis a great miſtake, and a very groundleſs prejudice againſt the ways of God, to conceive them to be ſo dark and uncomfortable, becauſe there is ſuch circumſpection required of thoſe that will walk in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be here granted, that they do indeed call us off from carnal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and from thoſe ſinful delights, concerning which, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2.2.</note> that they <hi>are madneſs;</hi> and a kind of mirth,
<note place="margin">Prov. 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>the end whereof is heavineſs.</hi> But is it to be accounted ſo great a miſery to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61506:70"/>off, and diſingaged from theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Pleaſures, from theſe dangerous and pernicious baits of ſin? Is it ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable a thing to go to Hell laughing; to be permitted to run on jollily and merrily to the Pit of Eternal Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as the ſilly Bird, that being overjoyed at the ſight of the alluring and killing Bait, gladly haſteneth to the Snare? Is there ſo much happineſs in being at liberty, to be joyfully ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to the Chambers of death,
<note place="margin">Prov. 5.7.</note> as <hi>the fool</hi> runs on ſinging and dancing <hi>to the correction of the ſtocks?</hi> If God be pleaſed to take us off from running on heedleſly and ſecurely upon theſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Precipices, ſhould we not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as our happineſs? Hath he reaſon to think himſelf hardly dealt with, or injured by me, from whoſe lips I ſnatch away a cup of ſweet and delicious Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which he is endeavouring to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down as greedily, as if it were a Cordial?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet is not this all. God calls us off from theſe killing Pleaſures, that we may exchange them for better; for ſafe, ſound and ſubſtantial Pleaſures, true Delights, ſatisfying Contentments, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and laſting Joys. Such are to be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61506:70"/>found in the ways of God; and the more any man denies himſelf, as to all ſinful Delights; the more ſtrictly, heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and circumſpectly he walks, the more of theſe ſpiritual Comforts and Refreſhings may he hope to enjoy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. Many of thoſe who ſeem to walk circumſpectly, and to be of a very ſtrict and ſevere converſation, ſeem to lead but heavy and uncomfortable lives. For who are more full of ſad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and inward Troubles? Who are more ſubject to doubtings and diſſatisfactions about their ſpiritual Eſtate? Who are more held under bondage through the fears of their Eternal miſcarrying, than many of theſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though all this be true, yet is this no prejudice, no juſt prejudice to circumſpect walking.</p>
               <p>For 1ſt, The cauſe hereof is moſtly in themſelves, and not in the ways of God; neither is it in the leaſt to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to their circumſpect walking, but rather to their not walking more circumſpectly. Their own careleſneſs,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61506:71"/>and want of due heed and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in their ways; their venturing on ſin, or inconſtancy and ſlothfulneſs in holy Duties, or ſome other miſcarriage, is often the true cauſe of all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Were they more circumſpect, they would be freer from troubles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes their troubles ariſe from their darkneſs, and miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Covenant of Grace, and the Terms on which God offers mercy unto Sinners.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes their troubles ariſe from their unbelief, and from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to be comforted, and their put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off, and thruſting away from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thoſe Comforts which God reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes their troubles are much from the temptations of <hi>Satan;</hi> God for divers wiſe and gracious Ends permitting them to be ſo exerciſed. But however it be, and from what cauſe ſoever their troubles proceed, while they are in God's ways, they are in the ways of peace, and all ſhall at length end in peace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the mean time, their condition at preſent, with all its diſadvantages, is a thouſand times better than the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61506:71"/>of thoſe who ſpend their days in ſinful Frolicks, and even glut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with carnal Pleaſures, and ſenſual Delights, and ſuddenly go down to Hell, and there meet with ſo much the more torment and ſorrow, by how much they lived more voluptuouſly and deliciouſly here. O thrice miſerable is their condition, who go from their heaven of ſenſual Delights and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions here, to an eternity of Miſery and torment in the other World! And thrice happy they, who having made choice of the narrow way that leadeth unto life, through many inward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and fears, and much outward tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation alſo, if need be, enter at laſt into the Kingdom of God; That bleſſed and glorious Kingdom, where all tears are wiped from their eyes, where ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joy ſhall be upon their heads. And ſo much in anſwer to that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. The God whom we ſerve is a God of mercy;
<note place="margin">Mich. 7.18. Pſal. 145.9.</note> 
                  <hi>He delighteth in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: And his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> There is no Attribute of God which the Holy Scriptures do more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61506:72"/>and magnify, than his Mercy. His Mercies being ſo great, why may we not hope to find mercy with him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we take ſome liberty, and be not ſo ſtrict and circumſpect? Can we apprehend that a God of ſo great mercy, will be ſo ſevere as to condemn us, caſt us into Hell, and expoſe us to everlaſting Torments for want of this circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though the Mercies of God be exceeding great, yet ſaving mercy is not extended to all, <hi>but reſerved for thoſe that fear him;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>for ſuch as keep his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and remember his commandments to do them.</hi> 'Tis for the truly humbled, penitent, and reformed Sinner. <hi>He that confeſſeth his ſin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and forſaketh it, ſhall have mercy God ſhews mercy to them that love him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 20.6</note> 
                  <hi>and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But as for ſuch as plead God's mercy, to juſtify themſelves in their careleſs and looſe converſation, theſe muſt expect no mercy from him. God never promiſed ſaving mercy to any that are not ſo ſtrict as to make conſcience of the leaſt ſin, and ſo circumſpect as to keep a watch over themſelves, that they be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with ſin. Without ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61506:72"/>of this circumſpection, no man can ſatisfy himſelf touching the truth of his Repentance, without which there is no forgiveneſs, no mercy to be looked for at the hands of God. For true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance neceſſarily includes a ſincere deſire and ſerious endeavour to relinquiſh all ſin: Now how can this ſerious and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt endeavour to leave all ſin, be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an holy warineſs and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection as that which hath been treated of? Can an uncircumſpect and careleſs perſon, that heeds not what he doth, or how he walks, that takes liberty to pleaſe himſelf, that ſticks not to run upon any temptations to ſin that lie in his way; can this perſon be thought to be one that ſeriouſly and earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to forſake all ſin? Nothing leſs; he that truly deſires, and ſeriouſly endeavours to forſake Sin, will be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect and watchful; if he be not, 'tis apparent that he hath no great edge againſt his Sin; there is as yet no ſuch deadly feud between him and his Sin, as is required in every true Penitent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. Chriſt hath freed us from the Law, and Believers now under the Goſpel are more at liberty than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:61506:73"/>they were. What neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there of ſo much ſtrictneſs and circumſpection? How doth ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere courſe of Life conſiſt with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that Chriſt hath purchaſed for us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt hath indeed freed us from any Obligation to the Ceremonial Law, and from the Moral Law as a Covenant of Works that requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and unerring obedience; we are not to be juſtified by the works of the Law, but by Faith in Chriſt. But however the Moral Law is ſtill in force as the Rule of Life, and we are ſtill under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power thereof. And that we are ſo, is manifeſt ſeveral ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.17.</note> Chriſt himſelf expreſly declares, that he came <hi>not to deſtroy the law, but to fulfill it.</hi> And the Apoſtle, even when he diſputes againſt juſtification by the works of the Law, is ſo far from aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are freed from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law, that he doth with much vehemency affirm the contrary;
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>yea we eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the law.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:61506:73"/>
               <p n="2">2. Our Saviour in his preaching eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where preſſeth Obedience to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, and urgeth the Duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And in particular his moſt Divine and Excellent Sermon on the Mount doth in great part conſiſt of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that Sermon he doth not only preſs the Duties of the Moral Law, but vindicate the Law it ſelf in many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and more ſtrictly enforceth Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto, and ſeverely threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the Diſobedient.</p>
               <p n="4">4 He declares,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.20.</note> that if our <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs exceed not the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> (who yet went very far in many things) <hi>we ſhall never enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Mercy to no Sinners but ſuch as take his yoke upon them;
<note place="margin">Mat. 11.29</note> And letting all workers of Iniquity, and wilful Tranſgreſſors of the Law know, that he will never acknowledge them for his, but utterly diſclaim them, and caſt them off at the great day of their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before him, notwithſtanding all their pleas and pretenſions for being owned by him.
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.23.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. As Chriſt himſelf ever called for Obedience to the Moral Law, and urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61506:74"/>the Duties thereof, ſo did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles after him. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his diſcourſe with <hi>Felix,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act 24.25</note> 
                  <hi>reaſoned of righteouſneſs, and temperance, and judgment to come.</hi> And writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 69, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> All which being Sins againſt the Moral Law, exclude Men out of Heaven; ſo ſtrictly doth God ſtill even now under the Goſpel inſiſt on and require Obedience to the Moral Law.
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1, 2.</note> And thus the Apoſtle preſſeth the Duty of Subjects to Magiſtrates, the Duty of Parents to Children, and of Children to Parents;
<note place="margin">Col. 3.18, 19, &amp;c. Col. 4.1.</note> as alſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Duties of Husbands and Wives, Maſters and Servants. He that peruſeth theſe Scriptures, how can he think that the Moral Law is now out of date, and no longer in force to them that have embraced the Goſpel, and by Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Goſpel is ſo far from diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Profeſſors thereof from Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61506:74"/>to the Law, that it more ſtrongly enforceth Obedience, and lays an higher Obligation thereunto upon Chriſtians than was laid upon the Jews; in regard that greater Light, and more powerful Motives and Inducements to Obedience are now afforded.

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Did Chriſt ever intend by his death to purchaſe for us a liberty of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Our Saviour hath plainly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

                  <hi>and few there be that find it.</hi> What can we ſay againſt ſuch plain, expreſs, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61506:75"/>abſolute paſſages of Scripture delivered by the mouth of him that is Truth it ſelf, and can neither deceive nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? A very weighty and dreadful Truth it is, that calls upon us all to give all diligence that we may be found in that ſmall number, which we are never likely to be, unleſs we walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If to walk circumſpectly be a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent on all Chriſtians, who is there amongſt us all that may think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf exempted from it? Who can plead for himſelf that he hath a particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to lead his Life in another manner, and to go to Heaven upon ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier terms than others may?</p>
               <p>But perhaps you will ſay, though we are all enjoined to walk circumſpectly, and though it be a Duty incumbent on all, yet 'tis not enjoined as abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation. We may hope God intends not to ſhut all out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that have not walked circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This were very hard.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I anſwer briefly, If it be a Duty to walk circumſpectly, then 'tis a Sin not ſo to walk; and every Sin unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, excludes a man out of Heaven.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61506:76"/>If any Man think this to be hard, he muſt know, that as hard as it is, God will never alter the terms on which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life is offered men, and frame more favourable and cheap terms to gratifie mens corrupt Affections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. Many who never walked with ſo much circumſpection, die peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably. When they are going out of the World, we hear of no complaints, no diſcovery of fears, no trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A man would not wiſh to leave the World with more peace and quiet than many of theſe do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To die without dread and horrour, or free from inward troubles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, is no certain and infallible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good Eſtate. Their Eſtate is never the better, or the more ſafe, becauſe they die quietly. Their Conſciences may be ſeared, and their Hearts may be ſo hardened as they may have no ſenſe of their Spiritual condition. We find by Experience, that this is the caſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a wicked man that hath led a very lewd and ungodly life. Ask many ſuch when they lye a dying, how 'tis with them, whether there be any thing
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61506:76"/>that troubles them, or lyes heavy upon their Conſciences? And they will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily anſwer, There is nothing that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them, nothing that diſturbs their peace. Ask them, if they be willing to die, and whether they be not afraid of death? Their anſwer is, they are very willing to die; and as for death, they fear it not. Now call you this a dying peaceably and comfortably, when men of very bad or careleſs Lives go out of the World faſt aſleep in carnal ſecurity? When they die without any ſenſe of their Spiritual and Everlaſting Eſtate? O be not deceived! 'tis certainly a very ſad and fearful thing, when a careleſs or wicked Life, without any evidence of after-repentance, is ſhut up in a quiet and undiſturbed death. How much better grounds of comfortable hopes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Everlaſting Eſtate of ſuch men were there, if they died under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fears and troubles from a ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and thorough ſence of the ſins of their Life! 'Tis very true, you will ſay, if they have been very wicked Men, great and notorious Sinners; But if the worſt that can be ſaid of them, is, that they have been careleſs and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in their Lives, the matter is not much.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Conſidering the corruption of our Nature, our ſtrong proneneſs to Evil, the many Temptations we meet with, and the malice and reſtleſneſs of Satan ever watching to take hold of all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages againſt us to hurry us into Sin; 'tis impoſſible but that a man of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and uncircumſpect Life, ſhould have led a very ſinful Life, and have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and heaped up a great deal of guilt; and therefore if ſuch a one without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of any After-repentance and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and without any trouble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of his Sins, go quietly out of the World, 'tis a ſad and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing; and though we may not raſhly and peremptorily paſs our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the Eternal Eſtate of particular Perſons, yet have we juſt cauſe to fear, and all things conſidered, we cannot but greatly fear how it may be with ſuch a one in the other World. Sure we are, without Repentance, whereof there was no evidence or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, he muſt everlaſtingly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</p>
               <p>So from the Duty of walking circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, I come to the Argument by which it is enforced, implied in the next words, <hi>Not as fools, but as wiſe.</hi> 'Tis

                  <hi>Wiſdom is before him that hath underſtanding.</hi> That is, He that hath underſtanding, the man that is truely wiſe, his wiſdom is before him to look right on, to ponder the path of his feet, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks,
<note place="margin">Prov. 4.25, 26.</note> to ſpy out and conſider his way, to direct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his ſteps. And ſo is this Proverb expounded by that other to the ſame purpoſe,
<note place="margin">Prov. 14.8</note> 
                  <hi>The wiſdom of the prudent is to underſtand his way;</hi> that's the uſe which he makes of his wiſdom; he is, as to that matter, wiſe for himſelf, in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Language ſtill:

As if a Man ſhould fix his Eyes on the Hills at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, where the Earth and the Heavens ſeem to meet, and in the mean time neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to heed his way, to obſerve where he treads, and what dangers he runs upon; as the Philoſopher who fell into a Pit whilſt his Eyes were taken up with
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61506:78"/>the Contemplation of the Celeſtial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Thus we ſee 'tis our wiſdom to walk circumſpectly; and 'tis ſo in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We hereby ſhun and avoid the greateſt Evils.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The favour of God; for while we are with God in a courſe of Obedience,

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By walking Circumſpectly, we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to our ſelves the Everlaſting well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of our Souls, which even in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans valuation of them are more worth than the whole World.

                  <hi>To him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There being theſe ſingular advantages of walking circumſpectly, you need not be much troubled at the Cenſures of the World. They who are ſtrangers to the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61506:79"/>ways of God, and were never acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Comforts of them, may count them little better than Fools that run not with them to the ſame exceſs of Riot: But this is more than enough to ſatisfie and quiet you, that what they count fooliſhneſs, the Holy Ghoſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with the Elogy of Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>So I have done with the great Duty of circumſpect walking, together with the reaſon by which it is enforced. I come now to ſpeak of the particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which our circumſpection ſhould be exerciſed; <hi>Redeeming the time.</hi> To redeem, properly is by laying down a price to purchaſe again, or recover that which another hath gotten poſſeſſion of: So a Captive or a Slave is redeemed out of the hand of an Enemy: So a Man redeems his Goods which have been pawned or ſold to another. Now in this very ſence to redeem time that is gone is impoſſible: For time is of that nature, that it can never be recovered when once 'tis loſt. All the Gold and Silver, all the Pearls and Richeſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the World, were not a price ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to purchaſe again, and recover one quarter of an hour when 'tis paſt: Wherefore by redeeming time, nothing
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61506:79"/>elſe can be underſtood, but a wiſe and holy improvement of the preſent time (to ſpeak vulgarly, for if we ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and acurately, no part of time is preſent; the preſent being only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant which is indiviſible.) This wiſe improvement of our time with double care and diligence, may however in an improper ſence be ſaid to be a redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miſ-ſpent time that is paſt; namely, as it makes amends for that loſs. As for Example, if a Man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving play'd away, and vainly loſt an hour, ſhall by extraordinary induſtry ſo improve the next hour as to diſpatch the work of two hours therein, he may be ſaid to have redeemed the hour that was loſt. And ſeeing the Apoſtle in this place intends the redeeming of time for heavenly things, (at leaſt principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not ſolely) as the whole ſeries of his diſcourſe ſhews, and not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming it for the things of the World; if time be ſometimes gained and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for heavenly things with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience or prejudice to our ſelves in Temporals, then we redeem it in a ſence not very improper; for the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience or prejudice that we ſuſtain in Temporal things, is as it were the price
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61506:80"/>that we lay down to redeem it. But we need not be too Critical or Accurate in explaining a phraſe where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſenſe and meaning is obvious and eaſie to be underſtood. Without all queſtion his intention in the expreſſion of redeeming time, is only this, that we ſhould ſo wiſely and carefully husband and imploy it for our Spiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as we may make the moſt of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the furthering of our Salvation; and ſuffer as little of it as is poſſible to be ſo laid out as no benefit may thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to our Souls. And in regard 'tis no eaſie matter thus to improve our time for Spiritual things, there being ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of an inferior nature that will be continually putting in for a ſhare in our time, and rob us of it; therefore the Apoſtle makes the redeeming of time for Spiritual ends and purpoſes, one main thing in which our Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be exerciſed; <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly, redeeming the time.</hi> Thus we have the Scope of the Apoſtle before us. They are not Temporal, but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly things chiefly, of which the Apoſtle is here diſcourſing; for theſe better and more excellent things we are exhorted to redeem the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61506:80"/>time, that is, to make the beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it which by our greateſt Care and Circumſpection we can, and this ſometimes even by undergoing ſome loſs and prejudice in other things. In diſcourſing of this Subject, keeping as near the phraſe in the Text as I can, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From what we muſt redeem the time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For what we muſt redeem it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How time is to be redeemed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why 'tis to be redeemed.</p>
               <p>And then make Application of what ſhall have been delivered.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe; from what muſt we redeem time?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, we muſt redeem it from all thoſe things that would ſeize it, and rob us of it. I ſhall mention ſome of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt redeem time from the World. The World, if we affect it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately, and purſue the things thereof eagerly, will ingroſs to it ſelf, and ſwallow up all our time, leaving us
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61506:81"/>none for better things, and things of higher Concernment to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt redeem time from the Fleſh. The Fleſh is alſo craving as well as the World; it would have all our time if it might, to be ſpent in what may gratifie Corrupt Nature; in ſleep, and eaſe, and paſtimes, and idleneſs; in pleaſing the Senſes, and pampering the Body, and giving ſatisfaction to Men's Luſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt redeem the time from Satan, who will likewiſe cheat us of it, and find out ſuch imployment for it, as no part of it may be gained for our Souls, if he can hinder it. Under theſe three, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, may be comprehended all thoſe things which ſo take up and ſteal away our time, as that our greateſt and moſt important work hath the leaſt part of it, if any part at all.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the firſt particular, from what we muſt redeem the time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For what muſt time be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? I anſwer, we muſt redeem the time for all thoſe great ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which our time here is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:61506:81"/>
               <p>As 1ſt. To attend upon the buſineſs of our lawful Callings, and to ſerve God and our Generation in the reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive places and ſtations in which God hath ſet us. And here every man is to conſider what that work is which God hath aſſigned him; what his proper bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and imployment is about which God hath ſet him; and he muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſpect and careful that he do not ſuffer needleſs divertiſements, and impertinent things to take him off from that work. And he muſt know, that he doth ſerve God in that work, as well as in Prayer, or any other ſpiritual Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whatſoever. Only, great care muſt be taken</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in thoſe his imployments he do what he doth in obedience to God, and with reſpect to his command who hath enjoined him to be diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in his Calling; and that he eye God therein, and aim at pleaſing him, and at being accepted with him;
<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.23.</note> 
                  <hi>doing every thing as unto the Lord, and not unto men,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt alſo be careful that he be not ſo intent upon the World, or any worldly thing, as to neglect his Soul,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61506:82"/>and the Duties that pertain to God's immediate Worſhip.</p>
               <p>Neither may it here be thought need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that men ſhould be called upon to redeem time for the duties of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Callings. For though many are too buſie that way devoting their whole time to the World; yet many others ſhamefully neglect their Callings, and ſuffer themſelves to be drawn off from their buſineſs by every divertiſement that comes in their way, and offers it ſelf. How well were it for many, if they could be perſuaded to redeem time from the Alchouſe, from the Tavern, from the Coffee-houſe, for the duties of their Calling; to redeem time from their lewd Acquaintance, and idle Companions; from their wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices and Aſſociates in ſin! Through their neglect to redeem and improve their time better, their poor Families may be half ſtarved at home, while they waſte their time in exceſs and lewdneſs abroad. I am apt to hope the Magiſtrates will do what they can to prevent or redreſs theſe lamentable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, unto which there were never more temptations than in theſe our days there are.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61506:82"/>
               <p n="2">2. Time muſt be redeemed for prayer, reading the Scriptures, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on heavenly things, ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, communing with your heart, and taking an account of your life. Theſe are the things, and others of like nature, for which eſpecially we are to redeem time, and which the Apoſtle chiefly aims at in this place, as hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Time muſt be redeemed for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the duties and offices of love to our Neighbours, whether they be ſuch as concern their Souls, or their Bodies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With relation to their Souls, time muſt be redeemed for teaching, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, counſelling, adviſing, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, admoniſhing and reproving them, as there ſhall be cauſe for it, and as their conditions ſhall require it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With relation to their Bodies, time muſt be redeemed for looking after them, providing for them, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſuch reliefs and ſuccours to them as they ſhall ſtand in need of. But above all, time muſt be redeemed for our own Souls, and for the things that refer to our ſpiritual and everlaſting welfare.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:61506:83"/>
               <p n="3">3. How is the time to be redeemed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By uſing our utmoſt diligence to make the beſt improvement of it that we can. And for our help and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therein, it will concern us</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be careful that we rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and diſtribute our time; allotting ſuch a proportion of it for attending the duties of our particular Callings, ſo much for neceſſary refreſhings, ſo much for holy duties, and ſo for the reſt of thoſe things which neceſſarily require ſome part of our time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be ever watchful againſt all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachers upon our time, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Thieves of our time, which will be every day attempting to ſteal away ſome part of it. What theſe Thieves of time are, every one beſt knows, who is beſt acquainted with his own Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the circumſtances of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He ſhould daily call himſelf to an account, and enquire how he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his time, and what uſe he hath made of it. And where he finds he hath miſpent any part of it, he ſhould be humbled for it, and reſolve to make
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61506:83"/>amends by greater care in husbanding his time for the future. And this he ſhould eſpecially be careful to do, where through his careleſneſs he hath miſimployed, or vainly ſquandred away that time which ſhould have been ſpent in the Service of God, and in the Duties that more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly refer to his Soul, and more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to the promoting of the good thereof.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, If a man ſhould every day thus reckon with himſelf, and call himſelf to an account concerning the imploying of every part of his time, this would be a very irkſome and tedious courſe. Who would endure to be ſo ſtrict and ſevere to himſelf, as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to himſelf for every hour in the day? This were an intolerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, a yoke too heavy to be born. To this I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whether we be willing to be accountable to our ſelves for our time daily, or no, we muſt be accountable to God for it, for every hour of it. And the beſt way to render our Account to God more eaſie, is to be daily calling our ſelves to an account. He that doth this, and doth it as he ought, makes
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61506:84"/>even Reckonings between God and his own Soul every day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may not think to get to Heaven ſo eaſily, as to undergo nothing in our way thither that may be tedious and unacceptable to our corrupt Nature. They who may hope to go to Heaven, muſt deny themſelves, and croſs the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inclinations of their Nature; they muſt ever and anon be rigid and ſevere to themſelves; they muſt be willing to take pains,

Forgetting the things that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, they muſt preſs towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God.</hi> If men dream of getting to Heaven without labour and difficulty, without offering ſome violence to their depraved and ſinful Natures, they are not likely to come thither. Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly 'tis not for nothing that our Saviour hath declared,
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.14.</note> 
                  <hi>That narrow is the way, and ſtrait is the gate that leadeth unto life.</hi> 'Tis a ſevere paſſage that we have; and deſerving to be ſeriouſly conſidered by all ſlothful Chriſtians, that would go to Heaven ſo as it might coſt them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:61506:84"/>
                  <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely be ſaved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>where ſhall the ungodly and ſinner appear?</hi> If the moſt righteous man after all the care and diligence which he hath uſed, and the pains which he hath taken to ſecure his Soul, be ſcarce ſaved at laſt; if all that he could do, be but juſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to bring him to Heaven, ſhall any man think to loiter away his time here, and waſt it as he pleaſeth, and yet make account to get to Heaven as well as thoſe who have been moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſollicitous, moſt diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in the uſe of all good means, to prevent the everlaſting miſcarrying of their Souls? <hi>Let no man ſo deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he reap:</hi> As men have been ſollicitous and diligent, or careleſs and ſlothful, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the concernments of their Souls here, ſo muſt they expect to fare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>They that ſow to the fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.8.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; And they that ſow to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, My Condition is ſuch, that how careful ſoever I be about what concerns my Soul, I can redeem but a very little time for things of that nature. My particular Calling ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61506:85"/>takes me up, that I can hardly gain one quarter of an hour in a day from it to be ſpent upon any thing elſe. I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This may ſometimes be through a man's own fault. Perhaps he takes more upon him, and incumbers himſelf with more buſineſs than he ought. No man ſhould ſo intangle himſelf with the Affairs of this World, as to ſhut out better things. Better let part of the World go, than indanger the loſs of your Soul. By ſo graſping the World, as to loſe your Soul, you would be a ſorry gainer in the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſing a man's Calling to be ſuch, as very little time can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from it for heavenly things; yet he muſt remember,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.42.</note> 
                  <hi>that one thing is needful;</hi> abſolutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary, and therefore he muſt find time for that one great thing, whatever elſe he omitted. Earthly things muſt ſo far give way to heavenly things, as that our Souls and eternal concernments be not neglected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But yet however it muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That God doth not require the ſame portion of time from all men. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61506:85"/>whoſe Condition is low and ſtrait, as to outward things; and ſome others alſo, whoſe time is neceſſarily and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably taken up with the duties of their particular Calling, may ſatisfy themſelves in allowing much leſs time for ſpiritual things, than others who are leſs ſtraitned, and more at liberty. But as for ſuch as have more leiſure, they may not think that no more is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of them, than of the other;
<note place="margin">Luke 12, 48.</note> 
                  <hi>For to whom much is given, of them much ſhall be required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if any have ſo much time to ſpare, as they know not how to imploy it, they muſt know that God will take it ill at their hands, unleſs they meaſure to him in ſome proportion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have. If they who ſo abound in time, ſhould think to put off God with a ſmall pittance of it, this were,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A great ſlighting of God, and would be ſo interpreted by him.
<note place="margin">Mal. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>He is a great king,</hi> and will accordingly be treated by his Subjects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It were a great undervaluing of his Grace, as if it were either ſo cheap a commodity, as that it might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61506:86"/>at any rate, and with leſs pains than any thing elſe that is of any value; or ſo vile and worthleſs a thing, as that time were ill beſtowed in labouring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It were a great undervaluing of our own Souls; as if we thought ſo meanly of them, that we grudged any time that is beſtowed on them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for thoſe, who in reſpect of their Callings, and the imployments in which the Providence of God hath inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, are much ſtraitned in time, and cannot help it; I ſhall recommend theſe three things to them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The leſs time they can redeem from their Callings for holy Duties, the more heavenly-minded let them labour to be while they follow their Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſetting God much before their eyes in the duties of their Calling; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to keep a good Conſcience, and to carry themſelves juſtly and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly in all their dealings; and upon all occaſions throughout the day ſending up many ſhort, but fervent, Prayers, and holy Ejaculations unto God. So doing, they may reſt aſſured, that they ſerve God acceptably in the Duties of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61506:86"/>their Calling, and ſhall accordingly be both accepted and rewarded. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance hereof we may ſee, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The leſs time they have for holy Duties, the more careful muſt they be, that the little time they have be not loſt in a ſlight, careleſs, formal and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs performance of holy Duties. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but little time for ſuch things, let them be ſure they make the moſt of it by a truly ſpiritual improvement of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The leſs time they can redeem from their Callings in the week time, the more careful let them be to ſpend the Lord's Day in a due manner, and ſo as may beſt conduce to their ſpiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. To be able to gain very little time from their Callings throughout the week, and alſo to ſpend the Lord's Day either in idleneſs or paſtimes, or in the meer outward formalities of Worſhip, void of all ſpiritual life and power, were the ready way to ſtarve your Souls. Such as do this, if they had any true grace, muſt needs be ſenſible of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual decays and declinings thereof, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be thoſe that never reflect upon themſelves, and take any account of the ſtate of their Souls.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:61506:87"/>
               <p>And ſo much touching the third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, how time is to be redeemed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why is time to be redeemed? There are many reaſons for it, but I ſhall here mention only ſome of them, reſerving the reſt to be after mentioned in the Application. We muſt redeem the time,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe 'tis a Talent for which we muſt give an account. Time is lent us, and put into our hands not to be waſted and trifled away as we pleaſe, but to be managed and imployed, to be laid out and expended according to the pleaſure of him who hath intruſted us with it. Wherefore our Account will be ſad, if when we ſhall be called to give it in, it ſhall appear that we have neglected the Work, for the diſpatching whereof time was allotted us, and ſpent our time in that which was no part of our buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt redeem the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our chief and moſt neceſſary work is limited to a certain time, the time of this our temporal life here. Our moſt neceſſary and important work here, is to make our peace with God,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61506:87"/>and get a title through Chriſt to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life when this ſhall be at an end. Now this work muſt be done here, or never; the other World is no place for it. <hi>Now is the accepted time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> Mercy is here offered, and we are called on, and importuned to accept of it; but after this life, the door of mercy will be for ever ſhut.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The continuance and duration of the time allotted us for this great work, is in ſundry reſpects very uncertain.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The life of man is uncertain. No man knows how near he may be to his long home. This may be the laſt day, this the laſt hour that he hath to live, for ought that he can tell. Who can give him any ſecurity for the lengthening out of his life one hour more?
<note place="margin">Pſal. 31.15. Pſal. 104.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Our times are in God's hand. When he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he takes away our breath, and we return to the duſt.</hi> And he hath not thought fit to reveal or declare when, or how he will do it; he hath given us no aſſurance that he will not put an end to our days before we go out of this place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If life be continued, 'tis uncertain whether or no the means of grace ſhall be continued. Though God lengthen
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61506:88"/>out mens lives, yet he often withdraws the means of grace from them; and he hath threatned to do it, where means are not improved, and where men walk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitably to them. Thus he threatned the <hi>Jews</hi> for their ſins,
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.43.</note> 
                  <hi>to take away his kingdom from them, and to give it to a notion bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> And to the ſame effect Chriſt threatned the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.5.</note> ſaying, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from whence thou art fallen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and do the firſt works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candleſtick out of his place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Though life and outward means of grace ſhould be continued, yet God may in wrath ſuſpend or withdraw the co-operation of his Spirit. Though the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoyed the miniſtry of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and he muſt prophecy to them, yet God tells him before-hand, that the iſſue of all his Labours among them would be no other than the hardning of them in their ſins.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 6.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>tell this people, hear ye indeed, but underſtand not; ſee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:61506:88"/>and convert, and be healed.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, Though God gave his Servant a command to propheſy to them, yet for their former ſins and provocations he would ſo give them up to the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own hearts, that they would be never the better, but the worſe, for having had a Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. A fearful thing, when thoſe means that ſhould open mens eyes, ſhall ſhut them; and when thoſe means that ſhould ſoften mens hearts, ſhall harden them. Let us take heed that this be not the caſe of any of us. If what ſhould convince, humble and reform us, take no other effect upon us, but that we are ſo much the worſe, the more remote from repentance, the more obſtinately and reſolutely bent after our ſinful courſes, the more incorrigible and irreclaimable, our Charge would be heavy when the day of reckoning comes. How dreadful and intolerable would the Sentence of Condemnation to be pronounced againſt us be, when the means we have enjoyed ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt us, and our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhall condemn us!</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the moſt neceſſary and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant work that we have to diſpatch, is
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61506:89"/>limited to a certain time, and the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that time is in divers reſpects very uncertain; ſo not to have impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that time, but to have left our greateſt buſineſs undone, till it be too late, and till the only ſeaſon in which it was to be done, be now over, and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably gone, is a moſt deplorable and diſmal thing. How affectionately did our Saviour weep over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect;
<note place="margin">Luke 19.41, 42.</note> ſaying, <hi>If thou hadſt known, even thou in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> When mercy was offered her, and ſhe was earneſtly importuned to accept of it, <hi>ſhe did not know the day of her viſitation,</hi> as it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 44. She ſlighted mercy, and refuſed the gracious tenders thereof.</p>
               <p>But wherein doth the miſery of ſuch a condition lie?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, in theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Having finally refuſed mercy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obſtinately perſiſted in the refuſal of it to the end, they ſhall never have the like offers any more. The day of grace with them is run out once for all, and ſhall never, never be recalled; no more opportunities of making their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61506:89"/>peace with God to eternity. The uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prayers of all the Saints in the Church Militant and Triumphant, if they ſhould all join together in ſuch a Suit, could not obtain the offer of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for the ſpace of one hour for any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally impenitent Sinner. He hath ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away his mercies, and 'tis utterly impoſſible that he ſhould recover what he hath wilfully deprived himſelf of: Lament his loſs he may, and rue it he ſhall to eternity, but retrieve it he never ſhall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing in which the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this condition lies, is, that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſuch perſons ſhall be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully heightened upon the account of the mercy that hath been offered them, which they have ſo wretchedly ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rejected. The Goſpel it ſelf ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly repreſents to us what a direful aggravation of their puniſhment this will be. We have three ſevere and moſt remarkable Scriptures to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>This is the condemnation,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.19.</note> the moſt ſore and dreadful condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11.21, 22, 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo unto thee Corazin, wo unto thee Bethſaida; It
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61506:90"/>ſhall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment, than for you. And thou Capernaum that art lifted up to heaven</hi> (namely in the means of grace which ſhe enjoyed, but improved not) <hi>Thou Capernaum which art lifted up to heaven, ſhalt be brought down to hell; it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the day judgment, than for thee. How ſhall we eſcape,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The laſt aggravation of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, is this, That the thoughts of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy once offered and rejected, and of their having wilfully made themſelves eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſerable, when they were in a capacity of being eternally happy, if they had not ſtood in their own light, and been wanting to themſelves; I ſay, the thoughts hereof will be in their Conſciences a never-dying Worm to torment them with unſpeakable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh to eternity. So diſmal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable a thing it is not to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the time and opportunities af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us for making our peace with God.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the Reaſons why we muſt redeem the time.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:61506:90"/>
               <p>I now proceed to the Application, which was the laſt thing to be ſpoken to. And here,</p>

               <p n="1">1. If Time be upon ſo many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to be redeemed, to be redeemed (eſpecially) for heavenly things, and to be improved for the good of our Souls; what may they think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who make little other uſe of their time, than to diſhonour God, debauch their Acquaintance and Companions in ſin, and to bring ſwift ruin and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon their own Souls? who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem time indeed, but 'tis for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their Luſts, for gratifying their Corruptions, for glutting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſinful Pleaſures, and ſenſual Delights, for heaping up ſin upon ſin, for filling up the meaſure of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, and making themſelves ripe for judgment. That ſpend their time in exceſs and intemperance, in riot and drunkenneſs, in chambering and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs; in ſetting their mouths againſt Heaven, in belching out horrid Oaths and Blaſphemies, in ſcoffing at Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and deriding Piety; that make it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61506:91"/>their buſineſs to ſow the Principles of Atheiſm, and to ſcatter the Seeds of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion and Profaneneſs in all Places and Companies where they come; to ſeduce, poiſon and corrupt all they meet with, <hi>and to make them twofold more the children of hell than themſelves.</hi> O how many ſuch wicked Inſtruments, ſuch Agitators for Hell, and Factors for the Devil, have our times produced! How doth City and Countrey abound with them! and what ſwarms of them are there to be found in all Quarters of the Land!</p>
               <p>Though ſuch as theſe come ſeldom to the Houſe of God, yet in regard they ſometimes drop in amongſt others; and in regard that no Congregation (if nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous at leaſt) can be preſumed to be without many lewd and vicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, though perhaps there may not be many that have arrived at the ſame height and exceſs of wickedneſs with thoſe before-mentioned:</p>
               <p>I ſhall propoſe theſe three Queſtions to all thoſe who ſpend their precious time in lewd and ungodly Practiſes, of what kind ſoever; or rather, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they would propoſe them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:61506:91"/>
               <p n="1">1. Let them ask themſelves, put the queſtion to their own Hearts and Conſciences, Whether they think, or can think, that God made them, and gave them excellent and immortal Souls to theſe ends? If they think he did, then it ſeems they are of opinion, that God gave them a being, to the end they might renounce their homage, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim their ſubjection to him, and ſerve the Devil: And that he ſtill preſerves them, upholds them in their being, to no other purpoſe, than that they may ſtill go on in the ſame ways of open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt himſelf, and defiance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Heaven. Certainly it were an high diſparagement, and an horrid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation to the wiſdom and holineſs of God, for any man to imagine that God ſhould make men, give them a being, continue being to them, and lengthen out their lives, that they might thus run out their time, and ſpend their days in a courſe of conſtant oppoſition and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt him that made them. Well then, you muſt be enforced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if you conſider the matter, that God gave you being, and allots you time here for other purpoſes than thoſe to which you apply it.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:61506:92"/>
               <p n="2">2. Ask your ſelves alſo whether you think there is no account to be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God of your time? If you allow your Servant time for diſpatching the work which you have injoined him, and you find the work undone when you come to view it, you call him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the time you gave him, and will know how he hath imployed it; whether he hath ſpent it in dileneſs, or what is worſe; and do you think that God will not have an account from you of your time? Will he be leſs ſevere and exact in reckoning with you for your time, than you are in reckoning with your Servant for it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ask your ſelf one queſtion more, to wit, Whether you think that ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on at this rate as you do, you ſhall be able with comfort to give up your account hereafter to God of the uſe you have made of your time? A true and juſt account muſt be given in whether you will or no; and how then will your account run, and what will the ſtyle of it be? So much of your time ſpent in Drinking, and Carouſing, and Swearing; ſo much in Chambering and Wantonneſs, and in whatever is not to be named; ſo much in Profane and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61506:92"/>Drolleries, and in making a mock of Sin, yea, of Piety, Religion, and Sobriety; ſo much in traducing and reproaching others, in impairing their Reputation, and wounding their good Name; ſo much in railing, fomenting and ſpreading evil Reports; ſo much in ſpeaking againſt your Brother, and ſlandering your own Mothers Son; ſo much in labouring to Infect, Poyſon, and ſeduce your Friends and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to ingage them in the ſame vitious and ungodly practices with your ſelf: What think you of ſuch a Bill as this? Do you not even tremble at the thought of giving in to God ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of your time? If <hi>Jezebel</hi> was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely threatned becauſe ſpace being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her to repent, <hi>ſhe repented not;</hi> What ſhall be their doom, who having ſpace given them to repent, do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglect to repent, but conſume, and laviſhly miſ-ſpend the whole time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for that Duty, in all manner of wicked and abominable practices?

               <p>If time be upon ſo many accounts to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61506:93"/>be redeemed, and if it muſt be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (eſpecially) for heavenly things, then what may they think of themſelves who trifle away their time vainly and fruitleſly? Who, inſtead of redeeming the time, ſtudy and contrive how they may be rid of it upon any terms. Time is a burthen to them, they know not what to do with it. They are at ſome pains in deviſing and inventing Arts to paſs it away. As if time ſtayed too long with them, and did not run out faſt enough of it ſelf. Now as for you that have ſo much time to ſpare, that are ſo much troubled with it, and know not how to beſtow it, or diſpoſe of it; let me put theſe queſtions to you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Have you done your great work? Have you made your peace with God? Have you gotten the pardon of your Sins? 'Tis very much to be feared, that ſuch as are thus troubled to know how to paſs away their time, and ſpend it ſo vainly, have done little towards that great and weighty buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Do you know the greatneſs and difficulty of this work? Do you know how much time it may require? Tho'
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61506:93"/>you ſhould begin to ſet about it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and uſe your utmoſt diligence about it, yet ſeeing you have ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed it, and put it off; ſeeing you have undervalued and ſlighted the offers of Mercy, God may juſtly make you wait long before you be upon good grounds fatisfied touching your peace with him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do you know how ſhort the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of your time may be? Do you know how ſoon death may ſurprize you, and how few ſteps there may be between you and the Grave? You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell but that this may be the laſt day that you have to live, and that to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row your Soul may be in another World, and ſo beyond all poſſibility of making your peace with God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do you conſider how different your Thoughts and valuation of Time may be when you come to die, from what they now are? Then you may ſo value it, as you may be willing to give the whole World, if you had it, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe one day, to purchaſe a few hours, to obtain, if it be poſſible, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your ſins <hi>before you go hence and be ſeen no more,</hi> before your Soul bid

               <p n="5">5. Do you conſider the high and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting conſequence of your imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your time while you are here? Do you conſider that your endleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable happineſs or miſery depends on the improving or not improving of this Moment of your abode here? For a Moment 'tis, and no other in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Eternity.

How careful have many of us been about our worldly buſineſs, that no time or opportunities for temporal advantages might be loſt, while the one

O how few hours in a Week, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in a Month have we redeemed for ſecret Prayer, Self-examination, and communing with our own hearts, for ſtating matters aright between God and our own Souls!

               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:61506:97"/>
               <p n="1">1. Lay before us that which hath been laſt ſpoken of; let us conſider how much time we have already miſ-ſpent, ſome in one kind, and ſome in another. I ſcarce know what ſtronger motive can be made uſe of to prevail with us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time than this. Having miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpent and loſt ſo much time already, doth it not highly concern us to make better uſe of what remains? Eſpecially if we likewiſe conſider, that as we have miſ-ſpent much time already, ſo we know not how little remains to be better imployed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider, that when you have been as good an husband of your time as 'tis poſſible, yet it cannot be but that much of it muſt have been loſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the care that hath been taken to prevent the loſs of it. Much of our time runs out in ſleep, much in eating and drinking, and other ways of neceſſary refreſhing; much in thoſe unavoidable divertiſements which every day we meet with. How much of our time do theſe things take up! Certainly the far greater part of every four and twenty hours is thus imployed, unleſs we be more provident than moſt men are, yea unleſs we be extraordinary
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:61506:97"/>husbands of time, and rare patterns of the well-managing and improving thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereunto add the motive in the Text; <hi>Let us redeem the time, becauſe the days are evil.</hi> And evil they are both in reſpect of the evil of Sin, and the many Temptations thereunto; and in reſpect of the evil of Affliction and Puniſhment which our Sins either have already brought upon us, or threaten us with.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The days are evil in reſpect of Sin, and the many Temptations thereunto. Never did, as I think, Sin more abound, than in theſe our days; never was it more ſhameleſs and impudent; never was there, I think, a greater deluge of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in City and Country, conſidering what means there are to prevent it: And never were there ſo many temptations to Sin, what by Seducers that compaſs Sea and Land to make Proſelytes, Proſelytes to <hi>Rome,</hi> and Proſelytes to I know not how many pernicious Sects, in great part created and fomented by Factors for <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſet a work and imployed by them; and what by other Inſtruments which the Devil hath in all places to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61506:98"/>men, and make them Atheiſts in Opinion, or in Life and Converſation; either practical or ſpeculative Atheiſts, or both. Was there ever ſuch an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Age as ours is, when ſo many eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe and avow Atheiſm, when they bluſh not openly to profeſs it, when they plead for it, when they diſpute for it, when they do all they can to ſpread and propagate it; and when ſo many more live like perfect Atheiſts, frame their lives no otherwiſe than they would or could do, if they verily believed that there is neither God nor Devil, neither Heaven nor Hell? O the ſad condition of our Age! that a Nation that hath had the light of the Goſpel ſo long, and ſo clearly ſhining amongſt them; that hath been, as it were, lifted up to Heaven in the means of Grace, and that hath been honoured and dignified with ſo many ſignal Deliverances, by which God hath from Heaven born witneſs, and given teſtimony to the Truth which we profeſs, ſhould, after all this, ſo wretchedly apoſtatize and decline both in Opinion and Practice, in Doctrine and Manners! In reſpect of Sin and Temptations our days are evil with a witneſs; ſo evil, that 'tis not eaſie to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:61506:98"/>conceive how they can be much worſe, or what further degrees of wickedneſs men can arrive at.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The days are evil in reſpect of the evil of Affliction and Puniſhments which our Sins have brought upon us, and further threaten us with.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are evil days in reſpect of the Afflictions and Puniſhments which our Sins have brought upon us. What Effuſion of Blood at home and abroad, by Sea and by Land! What vaſt expence of Treaſure! What weakning and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of mens Eſtates! What Mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our memory by a moſt grievous and terrible Peſtilence raging in the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, and in divers other parts of the Kingdom! What dreadful Fires in the Head City, and in many other places, beyond all that any of our Hiſtories make any report to have been in this Land! Heretofore, as far as I have heard or read of, ſo many, and ſuch terrible Fires within the like ſpace of time to have been in this Kingdom, no Memorials of former Times, (for ought I know) give us any account of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the days are evil, in reſpect of the ſore Afflictions and heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61506:99"/>which our Sins have already brought upon us, ſo are they evil alſo in reſpect of the Judgments which they further threaten us with. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle long ſince foretold,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1.</note> that <hi>in the laſt days perilous times ſhould come.</hi> Such are our times. There was never a time ſince the Reformation, when our juſt fears and dangers were greater than of late they have been. Neither the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Invaſion of Eighty Eight, nor the Gunpowder Plot, (though horrid At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts both of them) exceeded the Bloody and Fatal deſigns of the Enemies of Church and State in our days.</p>
               <p>O then, how much doth it concern us to redeem the time, <hi>becauſe the days are evil!</hi> To redeem it, for giving <hi>all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make our calling and election ſure,</hi> and for ſetling matters right between God and our own Souls; to redeem time for getting ſtrength to keep our ſelves untainted with the Corruptions of the Times, and ſtrength againſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of the many dangerous and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Temptations which we meet with; to redeem time for ſeeking God, and for offering up to him our moſt fervent and unceſſant Supplications for confounding the wicked Devices, for defeating the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61506:99"/>Bloody Counſels and Barbarous Deſigns, and for breaking in pieces the Diabolical Combinations and Traiterous Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of unreaſonable men, that are skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to deſtroy!</p>
               <p>To redeem time, for ſeeking God in behalf of the Reformed Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, groaning under the ſad Miſeries and Calamities of War and Perſecution; to redeem time, to humble our ſelves for our manifold Sins and Provocations here at home, and for averting thoſe heavy Judgments, which we may fear are hanging over our heads, and haſtening to come upon us, and may ſpeedily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake us, and ſurprize us, if by our timely Humiliation and ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance we prevent it not.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſufficient Reaſons to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of our time in ſuch order, as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the Concernments of our own Souls, and the Publick Welfare may have a good proportion of it applied that way. And the worſe the times are we live in, the more careful ſhould we be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS ſhort Epiſtle of St. <hi>John</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Gaius,</hi> a ſincere and zealous Chriſtian. Where he lived, and to what Church he belongod, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. But whereſoever his abode was, whether at <hi>Corinth, Derbe,</hi> or at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> or ſome-where elſe, 'tis evident that he was a man eminent for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and greatly uſeful in his place. The chief intention of St. <hi>John</hi> in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Epiſtle to him, ſeems to have been, that he might let him know how much he rejoyced to hear of the grace of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61506:101"/>God in him, and that he might encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to go on and perſevere in the profeſſion and practice of the truth which he had entertained.</p>
            <p>In the words which I have made choice of, we have the principal thing which the Apoſtle here takes notice of in him, commendeth him for, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth him in; and that is, his charity and hoſpitality to the Saints, in relieving them, and giving entertainment to them, or rather his uprightneſs and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity therein; <hi>Thou doſt faithfully what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou doſt to the brethren, and to ſtrangers.</hi> Which words, that they are to be underſtood of his Charity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and of his Hoſpitality in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the Saints, is manifeſt from what follows concerning the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in the 8th, 9th and 10th Verſes. <hi>Thou doſt faithfully whatſoever thou doſt to the brethren, and to ſtrangers.</hi> By the Brethren, we may underſtand thoſe who were of the ſame Church with <hi>Gaius,</hi> or at leaſt of the ſame City where his Habitation was; and by Strangers, thoſe other Chriſtians, who either through perſecution were conſtrained to come thither for ſhelter, or whoſe neceſſary buſineſs and ſecular affairs
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61506:101"/>drew them thither; or laſtly, who came to preach the Goſpel, as it ſeems they did, who are intended in the 7th and 8th Verſes, concerning whom the Apoſtle ſaith, that for his Name's ſake, that is, for Chriſt's ſake, they went forth, taking nothing of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and that therefore Chriſtians who were of ability ought to receive them, that they might thereby be Fellow helpers to the Truth, and promote the propagation of the Goſpel. And though theſe alſo were Brethren in a more general ſenſe; yet being Strangers, thoſe other at home might in a ſtricter ſenſe be ſo called, as being Brethren, not only in reſpect of their common Faith and profeſſion of the ſame Chriſtian Religion, but alſo in reſpect of their more particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one another, as fellow-members of the ſame ſame Church, or Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the ſame City.</p>
            <p>Now whereas among many other good things, which without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion were to be found in <hi>Gaius,</hi> the Apoſtle ſingles out this particular, <hi>That he did faithfully whatſoever he did in way of charity and kindneſs, both to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to ſtrangers;</hi> And whereas he doth not ſo much commend him for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61506:102"/>the thing done, how good ſoever in it ſelf conſidered, as for the manner of doing it; We may hence obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That 'tis a great duty of a Chriſtian to do every thing faithfully.</hi> In treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which point, I ſhall</p>
            <p n="1">1. Shew what it is to do all things faithfully; or wherein this faithfulneſs lies, and what the ingredients of it are.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Why 'tis ſo great a Duty, and what Reaſons there are why ſo much ſtreſs ſhould be laid upon it. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall apply what ſhall have been ſpoken.</p>
            <p>I begin with the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, which was, to ſhew what it is to do every thing faithfully. In the general, to do any thing faithfully, is nothing elſe but to do it ſincerely, and in ſingleneſs of heart, as looking unto God therein. This <hi>Hezekiah</hi> expreſſeth,
<note place="margin">2 Kings 20.3.</note> 
               <hi>by walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> And the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>by doing every thing heartily as unto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.23.</note> 
               <hi>and not unto men.</hi> Now herein there are theſe things comprehended.</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:61506:102"/>
            <p n="1">1. That we be careful to look to it, that whatſoever we do, is agreeable to our Maſter's will; that his pleaſure be the Rule by which we are guided in our Actions; that we do nothing but what we know he commands or allows: And that we do not in any thing prefer our own will before his; for that's one point of faithfulneſs in every Servant, to keep cloſe to his Commiſſion, and the pleaſure of his Maſter. This God much inſiſts on. <hi>Whatſoever thing I command you, obſerve to do it; thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor diminiſh from it,</hi> Deut. 12.32. <hi>Ye ſhall obſerve to do as the Lord your God hath commanded you; ye ſhall not turn aſide to the right hand, or to the left,</hi> Deut. 5.32. And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act obſervation of the Rule, and ſtrict adherence thereunto, is required even in thoſe caſes wherein our Reaſon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, may preſent and dictate ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe to be done, rather than what God commandeth. We muſt hearken to no ſuggeſtions of carnal Reaſon, where the pleaſure of God, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is clearly revealed to us. This God often cautions his People againſt; <hi>Ye ſhall not do after all that ye do this day, every man what is good in his eyes,</hi> Deut.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61506:103"/>12.8. So <hi>Numb</hi> 15.39. God would have his People of <hi>Iſrael look upon the fringe</hi> which he had enjoined ſhould be upon the <hi>borders of their garments, that they might remember all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, and do them; and not ſeek after their own heart, and their own eyes;</hi> that is, that they might not do that which they had a mind to do, and which their own depraved reaſon and ſenſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated to them, and led them unto, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God. So then, that's the firſt thing required in faithfulneſs, that we do what we have God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or allowance for, not preferring our will before his in any thing; nor ſo leaning to our own underſtanding, as to be thereby drawn aſide to the one hand, or the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In matters of duty, he that would do what he doth faithfully, muſt not only do what is commanded him, but do it in obedience to God, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Command. A Servant is not to be reputed faithful merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth what is agreeable to his Maſter's will, unleſs he do it in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and becauſe he is commanded; unleſs he eye his Maſter's Command, and do what he doth with reſpect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61506:103"/>A man may do many things that are commanded, for his own bye ends, and with reſpect to ſomewhat elſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than his Maſter's command; yea, though he do what is commanded, yet perhaps his Maſter's command had no influence upon him at all, and he would never have done it, unleſs there had been ſomewhat elſe to induce him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, beſides his Maſter's pleaſure. Your Servant hath a mind to go to ſuch a place, and thither he would have gone although you ſhould have forbidden him: You command him to go thither, and he goes; but doth he not go in his own Errand more than yours, who would have gone thither, though you had ſent him a contrary way? So God commands us many things which ſuit well with a man's worldly Intereſts and Deſigns, and thereupon a man doth what is commanded, but not ſo much becauſe 'tis commanded, as becauſe it furthers his own ſecular Advantages, and worldly Ends. Doth he herein what he doth faithfully? Doth he ſincerely ſerve his Maſter, or rather doth he not ſerve himſelf? Inſtances in this kind are eaſily to be found. To be diligent in a man's Calling, to be as good as a man's word,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61506:104"/>and as we ſay, to keep touch punctually with every one with whom a man hath any thing to do; to deal juſtly and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all men; theſe are things which God ſtrictly enjoins, and which he lays much weight on; but they are alſo things which make much for a man's Reputation in the World, which make others willing to imploy him, to deal with him, and truſt him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently which much conduce to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing of a man's worldly Eſtate. Now how many are there who do all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things which God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but without any reſpect at all to his command, and purely with reſpect to their worldly Intereſt, that they may preſerve their Reputation, have much trading, or be much truſted and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome other way, and thereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Eſtates, and raiſe their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Now though ſuch men may truly be ſaid to deal faithfully with men, yet can they never be ſaid to do what they do faithfully in reference to God, becauſe doing nothing of all this with reſpect to him, and in obedience to his command, they are not in truth ſo much his Servants in what they do, as their own. To do ſuch things as theſe, and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61506:104"/>all other things faithfully, in reference to God; to do them as <hi>Gaius</hi> did, is to do them with an eye on God, and with reſpect to his command. This was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s care,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.6.</note> 
               <hi>to have reſpect unto all God's commandments.</hi> To look at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and to do every thing as deſigning and aiming at a conformity thereunto: This is to do things <hi>in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of heart, as unto Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 6.5. <hi>And heartily as unto the Lord, and not unto men,</hi> as before, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To do any thing faithfully, is to do it from due motives, and to right ends, when the motives and ends of our Actions, which ſet us a work, and put us on, are ſuch as God requires and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of: Such as are</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Glory; This ought to be the principal end in all our Actions.

               <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye eat, or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> And to be ſure, there is no lawful Action, but is ſome way or other referrible to God's Glory; for otherwiſe, how could we be enjoined to do every thing to God's Glory? If there were any good Action uncapable of being referred to that end, it had been in vain to require that of us.</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61506:105"/>
            <p n="2">2. Another end which we are to propound to our ſelves, and aim at in our Actions, is, That we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pleaſe God, and have acceptance with him.
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.16.</note> The Apoſtle, exhorting to a charitable relieving of thoſe who are in want, draws an Argument to perſuade thereunto, from the acceptance that it hath with God; thereby giving us to underſtand, that God's being pleaſed with what we do, and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of us, ought to be one great thing in our eye whatſoever we do; <hi>To do good, and to communicate, forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi> The ſame Argument he uſeth, exhorting Children to be obedient to their Parents;
<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 3.20.</note> 
               <hi>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleaſing to the Lord.</hi> It was therefore <hi>David</hi>'s ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt prayer unto God, that all his thoughts and words might be pleaſing to God;
<note place="margin">Pſa. 19.14.</note> 
               <hi>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord, my ſtrength, and my redeemer.</hi> And this was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s great care and endeavour;

               <hi>We labour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that whether abſent or preſent, we may be accepted of him.</hi> And his Prayer in behalf of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> was,

               <hi>that they might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another end that we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our ſelves in our Actions, is the good of others, according to the nature and tendency of the Action, and ſo far as 'tis referrible to the good of our Brethren.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.14.</note> 
               <hi>Let all things be done with charity,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Now Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath a reſpect, not only to our own benefit, but alſo to the benefit of others. And again, <hi>Let no man ſeek his own,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.24.</note> 
               <hi>but every man another's wealth.</hi> Let him not ſeek his own wealth, his own profit or advantage alone, his own to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prejudice or hinderance of his Brother, but his Brother's as well as his own, and together with it.</p>
            <p>And thus we have ſeen what it is to do whatſoever a man doth faithfully: He doth every thing faithfully, who is carefully ſolicitous in all things to have his warrant or allowance from the Word of God; who in matters of duty hath an eye at God's Command, and doth not only what is commanded, but becauſe 'tis commanded; and laſtly, who doth all things from due motives, and to right ends.</p>
            <pb n="194" facs="tcp:61506:106"/>
            <p>Now in the ſecond place, why is it ſo great a thing, a Duty of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to a Chriſtian, <hi>to do whatſoever he doth faithfully?</hi> There are divers reaſons hereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Without this faithfulneſs no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is valued or accepted of God, who looks more after this, than any thing elſe; and where 'tis wanting, there the moſt ſpecious, the moſt ſplendid and glorious Services in his account ſignify little or nothing, whatever eſteem men may have of them. Whence is it that that the very Sacrifices of the wicked, the beſt things they do, are ſo far from being pleaſing unto God, that they are an abomination to him?
<note place="margin">Prov. 15.8.</note> Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do nothing faithfully? Is it not becauſe their hearts being rotten and unſound, they do nothing ſincerely in obedience to God, nothing from due motives and principles, nothing to right ends? Certainly this is one thing, and not the leaſt, that makes all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances ſtink in the noſtrils of God. Though the ſinfulneſs of their perſons otherwiſe, and the wickedneſs of their lives make God abhor their Services, as he often declares; yet this very thing,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61506:106"/>That they do nothing faithfully, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, in that manner, with that frame of heart, and to thoſe ends which he requires, is that which maketh their beſt Actions yet more abominable to him, as they come from them, and are performed by them. This is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeems to intend, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which he ſeems to give of this matter. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 21.27.</note> ſaith he, <hi>is abomination to the Lord; how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Tho the wickedneſs of his life be enough to make God loath every thing he doth, even his very Sacrifice; yet that he bringeth it with a wicked mind, that pretending to worſhip God his heart is falſe and deceitful, that he hath baſe ends and deſigns of his own in what he would be thought to do for God, and to God; this is that which makes his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices much more odious and abominable unto him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no Service ſo mean, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and worthleſs in man's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but is both accepted and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God; if it be done faithfully.
<note place="margin">Mark 9.42.</note> 
               <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall give to any one but a cup of cold water to drink in Chriſt's name,</hi> and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61506:107"/>becauſe he belongs to him,
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.42.</note> 
               <hi>to a diſciple in the name of a diſciple,</hi> as ſuch, and upon that account, <hi>he ſhall in no-wiſe loſe his reward.</hi> A man may give far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things than a Cup of cold water, and that to a Diſciple too, and yet ſhall he have no reward from God, if he give it upon ſome other undue conſideration, and for ſome bye ends of his own; but let him do what he doth faithfully and ſincerely, to a Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple, and he ſhall not loſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though he give him but a Cup of cold water to drink. He may be apt to think that ſo poor a thing as that is ſhall never be ſo far regarded, or taken notice of, as to be rewarded; but Chriſt with much earneſtneſs hath declared ſo much, and aſſured him, that ſo mean a thing as that is, ſo done, ſhall not go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. Our Saviour, to ratify his Promiſe ſo much the more, and to make it the ſtronger, uſeth ſuch a manner of ſpeech as hath a double emphaſis in it: He doth not barely affirm it, but he doth it with a ſerious and ſolemn Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he ſhall in no-wiſe loſe his reward.</hi> The poor Widow's two Mites which
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61506:107"/>made but a Farthing, were but a poor matter, a ſlender gift to be caſt into the Treaſury; but yet doing what in that kind ſhe was able, faithfully and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no doubt, what gracious acceptance had it with Chriſt, and what honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mention doth he make of it? <hi>Verily I ſay unto you</hi> (ſaid he to his Diſciples) <hi>that this poor widow hath caſt more in,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 12.42, 43.</note> 
               <hi>than all they which have caſt into the treaſury.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>others caſt in out of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but ſhe of her want did caſt in all that ſhe had, even all her living,</hi> as Chriſt there adds; and this indeed was a great thing; but unleſs ſhe had done it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and faithfully, her action had never had that high acceptance with Chriſt; if pride and vain-glory, or any other baſe aim had been at bottom, Chriſt the ſearcher of the heart, would have diſcerned it, and inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the action, would have abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it. In the 6th Chapter of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> v. 5, 6, 7, 8. the Apoſtle exhorting poor Servants to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their duty to their maſters according to the fleſh, faithfully,</hi> and faithfully alſo to their Maſter in Heaven, <hi>in ſingleneſs of heart, as unto Chriſt;</hi> and again, <hi>Not with eye ſervice, as men pleaſers, but as
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61506:108"/>the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart;</hi> and yet once more, <hi>with good-will doing ſervice as to the Lord, and not to men;</hi> he encourageth them thereunto from the conſideration of the reward of this their ſervice which they may expect from God; <hi>Knowing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi> What? tho he be not only a Servant, but a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, wholly at the command, and under the power of his Maſter, and by him imployed in the meaneſt ſervices, and put to the baſeſt drudgery, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to beſtow all his time, and lay out all his ſtrength that way; may this poor Bond-man, this contemptible and miſerable Slave, expect any reward of theſe his Services from God? Yes that he may, and he ſhall be ſure not to loſe his reward, if he do what he doth ſincerely and faithfully, if he obey his Maſter, and ſerve him faithfully in obedience to God, and do even his baſeſt drudgery in <hi>ſingleneſs of heart as to Chriſt, and as to the Lord, and not to man:</hi> Be he a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a bond man; be his ſervices and imployments honourable or baſe, all is one with God, faithfulneſs is that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61506:108"/>which God looks after; whatſoever is done faithfully, and by whomſoever, it ſhall be accepted and rewarded.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where this faithfulneſs is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there the better our Services are for ſubſtance, the more notoriouſly and groſly do we play the Hypocrites. For in ſuch Services we do in ſpecial manner pretend to honour God, and ſeek his Glory, which when 'tis only pretended, and we really mind nothing leſs than what we make ſhew of, how odious and abominable is this in the ſight of God, <hi>who is a Spirit, and will be ſerved in Spirit and in Truth!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.</note> 
               <hi>God is not mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> that is, he is not deluded, and put off with outward ſhews and appearances inſtead of realities, as men may be who look upon the outward appearance, but cannot look into the heart.</p>
            <p>So I have done with the two former things propounded, having ſhewed what it is to do every thing faithfully; and why this is ſo great and ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Duty.</p>
            <p>I now come to make Application, which was the third thing propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:61506:109"/>
               <head>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</head>
               <p>This preſents juſt matter of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to us all, even to the beſt amongſt us, in regard there is ſo little, ſo very little of this faithfulneſs to be found in our Actions and Services. We may be apt to think we have done a great deal of good ſeveral ways, and ſo pleaſe our ſelves in the expectation of our reward; but if things be well examined, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhall we be found to have done, that will be approved of, and further our account hereafter? How much Pride, Vain-glory and Hypocriſy, how much ſeeking of our ſelves, and our own things, inſtead of ſeeking the Glory of God, and the Things of Chriſt! How many of the good things which we have done, have been done by us upon other lower Conſiderations than the command of God; from other Motives, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ends, than that we might thereby honour and pleaſe him, and be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him! Inſtances of our miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages this way might be endleſs almoſt, if the time would permit, and it were expedient to enlarge ſo much. I ſhall touch at ſome few inſtances, that by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61506:109"/>our fairings in them we may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to underſtand our ſelves, and know how we ought to judge of our ſelves in reference to the reſt of our Life, and the various paſſages thereof.</p>
               <p>My firſt inſtance ſhall be that in which many here preſent are concerned, and 'tis that of mens Imployment in the way of their Trade and Commerce with others among whom their dealing is. This is the main buſineſs of their Life, and takes up the moſt conſiderable part of their time; to which I may alſo add, that 'tis the buſineſs on which their parts and ſtrength are moſtly laid out. Great pity therefore it were that little of what they do in this way ſhould turn to their account hereafter, as undoubtedly it will not, unleſs it be done faithfully and ſincerely, as unto God, and not to men. And yet here, how common a thing is it with moſt men in their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to look no further than their own outward Advantage, and the procuring a competent, or a fair and comfortable Livelihood and Subſiſtence for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and theirs? Where almoſt is the Perſon to be found, who doth everything in the way of that his Calling, as unto
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61506:110"/>God, and not to men, who ſets God before his Eyes as much as may be all the day long; who treats with every man he deals with, or hath to do with throughout the day, as in Gods ſight; who ſeeks and conſults the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as well as his own, in every Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be makes, in every parcel of Ware he ſells or buys; in a word, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth all the Duties of his particular Calling with a reſpect to God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, with an eye at pleaſing him, and being accepted of him. Lay your hands upon your Breaſts, and ask your own hearts, whether this be your daily practice, and what experimental ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance you have with theſe things. If you reflect upon your ſelf impartially, and ſearch narrowly, 'tis to be feared that you will find too much cauſe to be humbled for your failings.</p>
               <p>A ſecond inſtance, I ſhall give in thoſe who are intruſted with the managing of other mens Buſineſſes and Affairs in any kind, in which their Induſtry, Skill, Ability, and Faithfulneſs is required; They are diligent and induſtrious in the ways of their Employment, they have a care ſo to manage the Buſineſſes put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, and committed to their
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61506:110"/>truſt, as they may be able to give a good account of them, and to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves faithful to thoſe by whom they are intruſted, as it concerns them to be with reſpect to their Reputation, and their worldly Advantage alſo; for if they ſhould be ſlack, careleſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, who would make uſe of them, or imploy them? Who would care to intruſt them with any buſineſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment? But in the mean time, while for their own ends they are thus careful to approve themſelves faithful to men, where is their faithfulneſs to God? Are they as careful and ſolicitous how they may approve themſelves to him in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſineſs they manage, how they may pleaſe him, and be accepted of him? That ſome are ſo, far be it from me to queſtion; but Oh how few are theſe men? And how rarely to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many who ſcarce mind God at all, and who is hardly in all their Thoughts.</p>
               <p>A third inſtance may be in the poorer ſort, who are very painful and induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their way; for ſuch many of the poorer ſort are, (though many others of them eat the Bread of idleneſs, and will do it, for their hands refuſe to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:61506:111"/>and they will not have honeſt Imployment when they may); but I ſay thoſe before ſpoken of, are diligent and induſtrious, they riſe betimes in the morning, they follow their work cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the day, and go late to bed at night; a very commendable thing in them, and greatly to be encouraged; but yet alas! What's their great end in all this? What do they aim at? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that they may eat a piece of Bread, that they may have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to keep themſelves and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations alive, if any they have? Do they mind God in their Employment? Are they diligent in their Calling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he commands them ſo to be? And do they in that way of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment intend the ſerving of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? And do they ſeek his Glory in that their low condition of Life? Do they humbly and contentedly ſubmit to his Providence in thus diſpoſing of things, and in allotting them ſo ſlender a portion of the things of this Life, and putting them to get their Livelihood in ſo painful and laborious a way? And laſtly, as low as their condition is, do they ſeek to honour God in it as much as they can? If they do ſo, then they do
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61506:111"/>faithfully what they do in their mean condition; and they may aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that as their eye is on God, ſo God's Eye is on them, he takes notice of their faithfulneſs, and will aſſuredly reward it. But how few are they who look ſo high as to mind God at all, or in the leaſt ſtudy to approve themſelves to him?</p>
               <p>A fourth inſtance ſhall be in Servants. Though there were never more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the careleſneſs and unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Servants, and perhaps never more cauſe for ſuch complaints; yet there are thoſe who are diligent and faithful, and cannot juſtly be charged with idleneſs or unfaithfulneſs, or with any of thoſe other uſual faults for which Servants are blamed. And yet even amongſt theſe who are the beſt, and moſt careful to pleaſe thoſe whom they ſerve, and who do all they can to give them content, how few are there whoſe eyes are upon their Maſter in Heaven, and whoſe greateſt care it is ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Duty of their places, as to pleaſe him! Who according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles injunction before-mentioned do ſervice with <hi>ſingleneſs of heart as to the Lord, and not unto men!</hi> Who do all
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61506:112"/>the ſervice which they owe to man, as unto Chriſt, ſtudying to pleaſe him therein, and expecting their Wages and Reward from him! For the moſt part, even the better ſort of Servants, look no further than their Maſters here on Earth; as for God, their Maſter in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 'tis ſcarce in all their thoughts to pleaſe him; and yet without a care and ſtudy to pleaſe him, they are but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſers,
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.6.</note> as the Apoſtle calls them, and muſt never expect either reward or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance from God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another inſtance may be in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Children; to put them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As for many Parents, they are not without natural Love, Affection and Tenderneſs for their Children in their younger years; they are willing to take any pains with them, they can cheerfully undergo much trouble for them; and when they are grown up, they are full of careful thoughts about them, and ſo ſtudious of their temporal welfare, that they think they can never do enough to promote it. And yet 'tis poſſible that very little of all this may be done in obedience to God, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Authority and Command, who as he hath furniſhed them with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61506:112"/>Affections to put them on to do for their Children; ſo he hath by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand made it their Duty; without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of which command, they do theſe things no otherwiſe than the brute Beaſts feed, tender, and protect their young by natural Inſtinct, and from that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or inbred Affection, which both ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclines them to do it, and enables them to do it with delight and pleaſure. That many Parents are led to all that careful and ſolicitous travel and labour of Love which they undergo for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by no higher Principles or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, is manifeſt, becauſe if the command of God did prevail with them, it would alſo make them conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly Induſtrious in diſcharging their Duty to their Souls, which God hath as ſtrictly enjoined, and which he looks after as much, yea much more, as the Soul is more worth, and the everlaſting miſcarrying thereof of higher conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than that of their temporal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. But here how miſerably do they neglect them, and betray their Souls to Sin, Satan and Hell! While they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſtow any pains upon them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their Duty to God; nor uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61506:113"/>effectual means for preventing and reſtraining Sin in them. But neither is this the only evidence of their perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no part of their Duty to them in obedience to God; for if they did, then would the ſame command and authority of God alſo ingage them to reform their own Lives, and frame their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the Rule; then would they not, as many of them do, allow themſelves in ſinful ways, ſlighting God's Authority, and caſting his Word behind their back.</p>
               <p>And what hath been ſpoken of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the ſame likewiſe may be ſaid of Children. I ſpeak of Children grown up to years of ſome diſcretion, and able to put a difference between good and evil. They obey their Parents, (ſome of them, I mean, though many others are undutiful, headſtrong, and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) I ſay, the better ſort of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren obey their Parents, are unwilling to offend them, or incur their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but yet 'tis not the command of God that ſways them, or prevails with them. 'Tis becauſe they ſtand in ſome awe of their Parents, but not becauſe they ſtand in awe of God, who hath threatned to puniſh ſtubborn and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61506:113"/>Children, and hath promiſed to reward ſuch of them as are dutiful, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable and obedient, as is implied in the Motive annexed to the Fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 'Tis becauſe of their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on them, and in regard they live in expectation of further kindneſſes from them; but not with reſpect to God's command, who hath ſaid, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother;</hi> and, <hi>Children o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey your parents, for this is well-pleaſing unto God.</hi> Alas! This conſideration, that 'tis <hi>well-pleaſing unto God,</hi> hath not the leaſt influence upon that obedience which many Children yield unto their Parents, nor are they at all moved or ſtirred up to the performance of their Duty to them thereby.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have ſhewed in theſe few inſtances, unto which many more might be added, that though men may do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things, yet very little of what they do, may upon examination appear to have been done faithfully; ſo far are they from being capable of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Commendation given to <hi>Gaius,</hi> to whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Thou doſt faithfully whatſoever thou doſt, both to the brethren, and to ſtrangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:61506:114"/>
               <p>All that I ſhall further add by way of Application, ſhall be to ſhew, how this faithfulneſs may be known, and how it may be attained. A man may know himſelf to be faithful;</p>
               <p n="1">1. If he be univerſally Conſcientious, if he make Conſcience of one thing, as well as of another. Faithfulneſs will cauſe a man to have reſpect to his whole Duty, to all God's Commandments. If any known Duty be willingly and conſtantly neglected, 'tis a ſhrewd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that little elſe is done faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or at leaſt, ſo faithfully, as it ought to have been done. For thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which would engage a man to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in one thing, would alſo do it in all other things.
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.10</note> 
                  <hi>He that is faithful in that which is leaſt, is faithful alſo in much; and he that is unjuſt in the leaſt, is unjuſt alſo in much.</hi> Upon this ground it is that St.
<note place="margin">Jam 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, is guilty of all.</hi> The reaſon whereof he adds in the next Verſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame Authority of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and violated in the breach of any one Law, which ſhould prevail with us to yield obedience to all. And he, who
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61506:114"/>cares ſo little for God's Authority, as that notwithſtanding it he is bold to venture on Sin in one thing, would do it in other things, if there were the like opportunity and temptation offered. Wherefore God, who ſees the inward frame of his heart, and how it ſtands affected, looks upon him as guilty of the breach of the whole Law in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you have a ſight of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs; and if moreover you hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily bewail it, and ſincerely mourn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it; if you diſcern how apt you are to have by and low ends, to have baſe and unworthy ends in your beſt actions; to have your Eyes on man more than on God; to ſeek your Self, your own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, Credit, Reputation, more than your Maſter's Honour; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if theſe things be alſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and burthenſome to you; if you be humbled for them, if you hate them, if you conſtantly pray againſt them, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly oppoſe them, and ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; if it be thus with you, 'tis hence manifeſt that you would be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and conſequently that God merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looks upon you as faithful, in ſome good meaſure through his Son, and will
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61506:115"/>for his ſake accordingly treat you, and deal with you. But 'tis much to be feared, that there is little or no faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where there is no diſcerning of a man's unfaithfulneſs; no bewailing it, or ſtriving againſt it. As 'tis a ſign that there is little or no Faith, where there is not a ſight and a ſenſe of the weakneſs of a man's Faith, and of his Unbelief; and conſequently where there is no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing it, no ſtriving againſt it; where there are no ſerious endeavours to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the remainders of a man's unbelief, and to ſtrengthen his Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You may warrantably conclude, that you are, in ſome meaſure, faithful unto God in managing the Services and Employments in which his Providence engageth you; if, when you have done your Duty in ſome weak meaſure as you are able, nothing elſe can ſatisfie you, but God's acceptance of your miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Is acceptation with men, good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, commendation and applauſe from the World, nothing to you, unleſs God be pleaſed to diſcover his acceptance of you? Are you reſtleſs and unſatisfied, unleſs he be pleaſed ſome way or other to let you know that he is well-pleaſed with what you have done? And doth
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61506:115"/>his acceptance quiet your mind, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy your ſoul, whatever men judge of you, yea, though all the world ſhould diſlike, and cenſure your actions? This is a great Argument, and a ſolid ground of ſatisfaction to you, that your aim was to pleaſe God, and to approve your ſelf to him; that you did what you did ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and faithfully as unto him, and not unto men. But if mens acceptance of you, if their good thoughts of you, and good words do ſatisfy you, and you look no further; if having this, you are quiet, and at reſt; you have great cauſe to ſuſpect your ſelf, or rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt your ſelf, that you have what you aimed at, and that your main deſign was to pleaſe men rather than God. Had your eye been upon God, and had your chief aim and deſire been to pleaſe him, and to be accepted of him, nothing elſe beſides his acceptance would have ſatisfied you.</p>
               <p>Now if you ask how you may attain to do every thing faithfully; I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt remember God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Omniſcience. That Servant will think it concerns him to be faithful, who knows his Maſter's eye is upon
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61506:116"/>him, and that he narrowly looks after him, and obſerves how he carries himſelf in the Services in which he is imployed. How much more would the conſideration of God's Eye make us faithful? for he ſees not as man ſees, he looks upon the Heart, obſerves not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is done, but how 'tis done; what the deſire, intent, and deſign of the heart is in every thing that is done. Yea, the inward diſpoſition and frame of the heart in all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is that which, above all things, he looks after and obſerves. Now he that ſhall believe, remember, and ſeriouſly mind this, how can he chuſe but do his beſt endeavour to do every thing faithfully as in his ſight, who <hi>ſearcheth the heart, and tries the reins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Watch your hearts in all things, which you ſet about, take in hand, or apply your ſelf unto; and obſerve the inward Principles, Motives and Ends of all your Actions. Though you know the things which you do to be lawful, and to be, perhaps, not only lawful, but your Duty; and though there be in you general In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and Reſolutions to do every thing faithfully; yet ſuch is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61506:116"/>of your heart, that you will find it often interpoſeth and mingleth it ſelf with your beſt actions, vitiating and depraving them, by putting you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them from undue Motives, and to baſe and unworthy ends. Wherefore, beſides your general Reſolutions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in all things to act faithfully, it will be of great concernment to you, that you often put the queſtion to your Soul, and ask, or interrogate your ſelf, ſaying, Why do I, or ſay I, this or that? What is it which at this time moves me thereunto? What's my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent end or deſign therein? If we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thus reflected on our ſelves, and examined the Principles of our words and actions, as we ſhould thereby often diſcover the falſeneſs of our hearts, and our unfaithfulneſs in what we do; ſo it would be a great means to make us faithful, and to keep us that we act not from thoſe undue and ſiniſter motives, and to thoſe by and unworthy ends, which too often prevail in us, and have too great an influence upon our Actions.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember always and conſider, that 'tis your great intereſt to do every thing faithfully, becauſe otherwiſe all that which you do is loſt, and your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:61506:117"/>is laid out to no purpoſe; for you can neither look for acceptance nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thereof, nor comfort therein.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You can never expect acceptance with God. When you never aimed at pleaſing him, nor looked after accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, how ſhould you be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted? Can thoſe your actions pleaſe him, which were never done with any ſuch intent, to the undertaking where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you were wholly ſwayed by other Conſiderations, and which you would never have ſet your ſelf about, had not other Motives induced you thereunto?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Much leſs can you expect any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the hands of God, of what is not done faithfully. Why ſhould God reward you for that ſervice, which was not intended to be done for him, but for your ſelf, or for ſome other Maſter? For that ſervice in which his glory was not aimed at, but your own reputation and advantage, or your worldly intereſt one way or other? When the Scribes and Phariſees were vain-glorious and hypocritical in their Duties; Praying, and giving Alms only to be ſeen of men, Chriſt ſaid of them,
<note place="margin">Mat 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>They have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> They ſought only praiſe, and
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61506:117"/>commendation from men; and they have what they ſought after. Men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud them, and ſpeak well of them, and that's all the reward they muſt look for. As for God, they muſt expect no reward from him, whom they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to pleaſe, or honour by their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither can they have any ſound comfort in what is not done faithfully. If the moſt excellent and glorious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and which are moſt highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, valued and magnified by men, ſhould be ſo done, as God would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accept nor reward them, what true comfort could any man have in them? If God frown upon a man, what good will the ſmiles of all the World do him? <hi>In his favour,</hi> and gracious acceptance,

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE words, as we ſee, contain two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; the former of which is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the rich and the poor meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The latter,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Lord is the maker of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both theſe Propoſitions may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſeveral ways; I ſhall ſpeak of them in order; and firſt of the former Propoſition,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The rich and the poor meet together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words are capable of many Interpretations, and 'tis not eaſie to judge which of them <hi>Solomon</hi> chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. 'Tis poſſible that he might
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:61506:119"/>purpoſely expreſs himſelf in ſuch terms, as that we might not be able to reſtrain the words to any one ſenſe, excluding all other Interpretations. In ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures where divers Expoſitions carry e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual probability, ſo that we know not well which to embrace, or which to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the ſafeſt way for the moſt part is to take in all thoſe ſenſes which the words will naturally and fairly admit of; ſo among them all we ſhall be ſure to have that which was aimed at. As to our preſent buſineſs, The rich and the poor may be ſaid to meet together,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the common nature of Mankind in which they agree, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever other difference there may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p>As for their Bodies, there is the ſame rare compoſure and admirable artifice in both, the ſame infinite Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs of God diſcovered in framing the Bodies of the one, as of the other; there is not a Limb, nor a Joint, nor a Bone, nor a Sinew, nor a Vein, nor an Artery, nor a Muſcle, nor a Nerve, nor a Griſtle, nor the leaſt ſtring or little inſtrument of vital or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal operation or motions, but is alike
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:61506:119"/>to be found in the one as in the other, and all alike exquiſitely framed and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the reſpective uſes and ſervices in the Body. In a word; The Body of the poor man is in all reſpects as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully made, as that of the rich.</p>
            <p>Then as to their better part, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the poor man is endowed with as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Soul as the rich man. Hath the rich man a Soul endowed with the admired faculties of reaſon, and liberty of will? ſo hath the poor man. Have the rich an immortal Soul that ſhall have a Being to eternity? ſo have the poor. Hath the rich man the Image of God ſtampt upon his Soul? ſo hath the poor. Doth the Soul of the one owe its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal immediatly and ſolely to God? and ſo doth the Soul of the other. Is God the Father of the Spirits of the rich? ſo is he of the Spirits of the poor. Is the Soul of the rich capable of unſpeakable and endleſs happineſs in the immediate viſion and fruition of God, <hi>in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is the fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?</hi> ſo is the Soul of the pooreſt, every way as capable thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The rich and the poor meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the mutual dependance
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:61506:120"/>they have upon each other, and the need the one hath of the other. As the poor man cannot live without the rich man, ſo neither can the rich live without the poor. The poor cannot live without the charity and aſſiſtance of the rich, and the rich cannot live without the Service of the poor. How many poor mens Service is neceſſary towards the making of the rich man's Clothing, and the furniſhing of his Table! Doth he wear one Suit of Apparrel, or make one Meal, unto which the labour of the poor man's hands doth not ſome way or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, either immediately or mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.9.</note> and more remotely? <hi>The king him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ſerved by the field.</hi> And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor mens labour doth the Field re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in manuring, and plowing, and harrowing, and ſowing, and fencing, and weeding, and reaping, and inning the Fruits of the Earth! And yet after that all this is done, the Corn that is thus houſed, is not preſently without any more ado made food; there muſt be threſhing, and winnowing, and grinding, and baking, in which the ſervice of many poor mens hands is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, before the King himſelf can eat a bit of Bread. And as for the Pride
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:61506:120"/>and Luxury of many rich men, it were endleſs to reckon up how many poor mens hands in ſeveral ways of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are made uſe of to ſupply and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with materials by which theſe their Vices are fed and maintained.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The rich and the poor meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of their joint abode, neighbourhood, and cohabitation here in this World. There is no place where they are not both to be found. In all places where men live together for the mutual help and defence of one another, God's wiſe Providence hath mingled the rich and the poor together. Shew me a rich man's ſtately and well-furniſhed Houſe, and I ſhall not need to go far to ſhew you a poor man's Cottage: and ſo on the contrary. And indeed 'tis needful it ſhould ſo be, for as I have juſt now ſhewed, neither of them could be without the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The rich and the poor meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of the care and good Providence of God, that is alike extended to both. They are both under the ſame gracious Providence that looks after, provides for, preſerves, ſafeguards and protects them both, though in ways
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:61506:121"/>ſomewhat different. The rich cannot ſay that God only regards them, and fixeth the eye of his Providence on them alone; neither can the poor complain that God diſregards or neglects them. <hi>The Lord is good to all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 145.9.</note> 
               <hi>his mercy is over all his works.</hi> And ſo far is he from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving denied the poor the benefit of his gracious Providence, that in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their deſtitute, diſconſolate, and helpleſs condition, he hath many ways expreſſed his particular and tender care of them above others, as may elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where be ſhewed. Many Laws he hath made in behalf of them, many promiſes he hath made to them; he hath laid many charges on the rich to be helpful to them, and made many promiſes alſo to encourage them thereunto.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The rich and the poor meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame poſſibility and capacity of exchanging Conditions with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As the rich is capable of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor, ſo the poor is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made rich. The high Poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth diſpenceth outward things as he ſees good, and to whom he pleaſeth. He can fill the hand of the poor, and empty the hand of the rich, whenſoever he will: He can reduce the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:61506:121"/>rich to ſuch a condition, as that the ſame hand that was wont to give relief, ſhall receive it; and he can advance the poor to ſuch a condition, as that the ſame hand which received relief, ſhall give it: Such ſtrange turns of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we often ſee. <hi>God,</hi> according to his good pleaſure, <hi>putteth down one, and ſetteth up another,</hi> Pſal. 75.7. <hi>He raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the poor out of the duſt, and lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill; that he may ſet him with princes, even the princes of his people,</hi> Pſal. 113.7, 8. And he maketh thoſe that were <hi>brought up in ſcarlet, to imbrace dunghills,</hi> Lam. 4.5.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to the ſecond Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord is the maker of them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which, when I ſhall alſo have ſpoken unto, I ſhall then make application of both together.</p>
            <p>This latter Propoſition may alſo be diverſly underſtood. The rich and the poor may be conſidered, either as men, or as diſtinguiſhed from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the different adjuncts of Riches and Poverty. Now take them under which of theſe two Conſiderations
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:61506:122"/>you pleaſe, <hi>the Lord is the maker of them both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If you conſider them both as men, ſo God is the maker of them all. And this, whether we look back to the firſt origine of Mankind, or whether we conſider them as taking their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from their more immediate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
            <p>If we look unto the Rock whence we were all hewen, and to the Pit whence we were digged; if we look back to our firſt Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> in them we all came out of the hands of God by creation; he framed the firſt man out of the duſt of the Earth, and the firſt Woman out of the Rib of Man, and breathed into them the breath of life, endued them both with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul. In this Divine Original, in the honour of this miraculous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the poor man hath an equal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with the rich man; the rich cannot claim nearer kindred to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> than the poor; the poor can call <hi>Adam</hi> Grandfather, and <hi>Eve</hi> Grandmother, by as good right as the rich.</p>
            <pb n="227" facs="tcp:61506:122"/>
            <p>Again, if we conſider them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their more immediate Parents, as they derive their beginning from them, ſetting aſide for the preſent the external and accidental conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Riches and Poverty, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Diſhonour, and the like, which will come to be ſpoken of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; ſo God is the maker of them both; neither hath the Rich and Noble, conſidered merely as a Man, any preeminence in his birth above the poor and ignoble. They both are alike <hi>fearfully made,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the earth,</hi> that is, in their Mother's Womb: <hi>In God's book were all the members of them both written; which in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them.</hi> And when the Body was by the concurrence of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Wiſdom and Power fitted to receive and entertain the Soul, and made a meet Receptacle and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſo excellent a Being, God infuſed the Soul into the Body, by his immediate Almighty Power, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it a being out of nothing, and in a wonderful manner, far tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61506:123"/>our apprehenſion, united the one to the other. And all this expence of Wiſdom and Power he equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon the Rich and the Poor. And then they both endure the ſame confinement and impriſonment in the Womb; the Infant of the rich and Noble hath no more room there, nor is it ſooner at liberty than the Infant of the Beggar. And ſo at the length the ſame Wiſdom, Power, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſends them both alike into the World; the Infant of the meaneſt, the loweſt, doth not put the Mother to more pains in the birth, than the Infant of the higheſt, it may be to a great deal leſs. And how different ſoever their entertainment is when they are come into the World, yet God ſends them both into it alike; the Infant of the Prince, that ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne, is as naked and ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the Infant of the pooreſt that imbraceth Dunghills. And thus we have ſeen, that God is the maker of them both, conſidered as men; and that as ſuch, God makes the rich and the poor alike, putting no diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them, nor being at
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:61506:123"/>any greater expence of Wiſdom and Power in making of the one, than he is in making of the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the rich and the poor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as they are diſtinguiſhed by thoſe adjuncts of Riches and Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo likewiſe God is the maker of them both. 'Tis God's Providence that puts theſe external Differences between men. <hi>The Lord maketh poor,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.7.</note> 
               <hi>and maketh rich; he bringeth low, and lifteth up,</hi> as <hi>Hannah</hi> ſings. 'Tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance, nor by man's skill or induſtry alone, that men become rich, but by the bleſſing of God upon skill and induſtry, and his over-ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that gives out, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes theſe things by no other rule than <hi>the good pleaſure of him, who worketh all things according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his own will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to the ſtrong; neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor riches to men of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, nor favour to men of skill;</hi> Eccleſ. 9.11. <hi>It is God that giveth men power to get wealth,</hi> Deut. 8.18.</p>

            <p>This we ſee by experience. Men of great skill and abilities, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the World, and know how to manage ther Affairs to the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; that lay many wiſe Plots, and have many ingenious Deſigns for raiſing themſelves, and advancing their Eſtates; that by their wit and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt put themſelves into many very probable ways of attaining Riches; yet they do but labour in the fire, lay out their wit, and ſpend their ſtrength for nought. All their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Contrivances are but as the Spider's Web, finely and curiouſly ſpun indeed, and drawn out of the very bowels of the Creature; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly broken to pieces, and ſwept away with one little bruſh of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. If God do but blow upon mens wiſeſt Counſels for advantaging themſelves, they are preſently blaſted, they wither, fade away, and come to nothing. And ſo we may obſerve on the other ſide, That men of far weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts, leſs skill, leſs forecaſt and contrivance, leſs ability for managing their Affairs, yet many times, through the bleſſing of God, who giveth power
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:61506:124"/>to get wealth, attain unto great Eſtates. In theſe, as in all other things, God's bleſſing and over-ruling Providence are all in all. The <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> diſcourſing of the inconſtancy and inſtability of all earthly things, cries out, <hi>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: To be laid in the ballance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</hi> And hereupon he counſels men not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on any of theſe things, nor to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their Affections to be faſtened to them; <hi>If riches increaſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 62.9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>ſet not your heart upon them:</hi> And then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he adds in the next Verſe, <hi>God hath ſpoken once, twice have I heard this, That power belongeth to God.</hi> As if he had ſaid, 'Tis a Divine Oracle worthy to be believed, which I have heard from the mouth of God more than once, <hi>That power belongeth to God;</hi> 'tis in the hand of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to diſpoſe of theſe things, to give them, and take them away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at pleaſure; and therefore he, and he only is to be truſted in, and relied on. And as for Riches, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for Poverty, 'tis an effect of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:61506:125"/>God's Providence alſo; though many times as a juſt puniſhment of mens waſtfulneſs, prodigality, unthriftineſs, idleneſs, and many other ſins. But many there are, who though they be induſtrious and unblameable, yet the moſt wiſe Providence of God keeps them low ſtill; and whenſoever they begin to get ſomething about them, and to put up their heads a little, God provides ſomewhat to pull them down again, that meaner Condition being that which his Wiſdom judgeth to be meeteſt for them. We uſe to ſay, Some are born to be poor. There is ſomewhat of truth in it, if we underſtand it aright. As God hath, as it were, deſtined and ordained ſome to be rich, ſo he hath deſtined ſome to poverty. Poor they are, and poor they ſhall be; do they what they can to ſhake of their poverty, they ſhall never be rid of it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet ought any man to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this diſpenſation of God; much leſs to charge God fooliſhly, as if he had not done herein what is beſt. Fooliſh man may be apt to think how much better it had been if God
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:61506:125"/>had made all men rich, and Poverty had been a thing which the World never knew. But let no man oppoſe his own fooliſhneſs to God's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Who hath been his counſellor?</hi> Rom. 11.34. <hi>Shall any teach God knowledge?</hi> Job 21.22. It becomes us, weak, blind, and ſhallow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that we are, ever-more to think well of what God doth, whether we can diſcern the grounds and reaſons of his Providence or no; and to have a holy veneration even for thoſe his Works, the cauſes whereof we do not underſtand, nor are able to give an account of. But as to the matter in hand, though perhaps it may not be needful nor expedient that we ſhould know all the reaſons which God had for putting ſuch a difference between men, making ſome of them to be rich, and others poor; yet ſome imperfect account of ſome of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Diſpenſation we can give. That God doth no man any wrong in with-holding the things of this World from him, while he is pleaſed to load others with his benefits, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them as much as heart can wiſh,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:61506:126"/>will be readily granted by all who acknowledge God's Sovereignty, and allow him to have a rightful power to do as he pleaſeth with his own. Beſides, who can challenge any thing, a crumb of Bread, or a drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the hands of God? He that hath leaſt, muſt he not confeſs that he hath more than he hath deſerved? <hi>Who hath firſt given unto him?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being:</hi> And ſeeing he hath given us our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all our Powers and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we can render nothing to him in way of ſervice, or otherwiſe, but what we have received from him. Can we deſerve any thing at his hands by rendring him that which was his own before, that which we owed him? Again, beſides all this, we have all, by our manifold ſins, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual provocations, deſerved to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of whatever mercy we enjoy. We ſhould long ago have been turned into Hell, if we had had our due, and been dealt with according to our ſins: And how much more then have we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be ſtripped of all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts?
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:61506:126"/>Be it never ſo little and ſo mean that you have, you had not now had it, if God had been extream to mark what you had done amiſs. It had been all gone, it had been ſnatcht away from you in diſpleaſure, if God's patience and long-ſufferance had not ſtood you in more ſtead than any deferts of your own.</p>
            <p>Well then, this I take for granted, that he who is in the pooreſt, the moſt deſtitute, the moſt forlorn, the moſt deſolate and deſpicable condition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you all, is convinced that God hath done him no wrong, nor can do any man wrong, by denying him that which he is not bound to give him.</p>
            <p>Now moreover, that God in putting ſuch a difference between men, is not only juſt, but moſt wiſe and good, may appear to any man that ſhall duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this diſpenſation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis for the Order and Beauty of the Univerſe, that there ſhould be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in the World, and interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Viciſſitudes of things; Winter and Summer, Spring and Autumn, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Health, Proſperity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:61506:127"/>Light and Darkneſs, do all contribute, though in ſeveral ways, to adorn and beautify the Creation, and ſet forth the Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs of the Creator. And even thoſe things which in ſome mens eyes may ſeem to be the ſpots and blemiſhes of the Creation, (for ſo men of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſpirits may be too prone to judge of them) do as well contribute to the beauty and luſtre of the whole, as thoſe things that are of eminent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perfection. Even Monſters ſerve to ſet forth and commend the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, in the exact frame, due lineaments, right proportions and features, ſtrength and beauty of perfect Creatures. So the poor, ſtrait, and indigent condition of ſome, ſo much the more commends the Bounty and Goodneſs of God to others; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes them, at leaſt ſhould provoke them to ſo much the greater love and thankfulneſs to that God who hath been ſo bountiful to them, and hath been pleaſed to put ſuch a difference between them and others, and this albeit they have deſerved at the hands of God no more than thoſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61506:127"/>who are in the moſt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This difference which God hath put between men, affords the Rich opportunities of exerciſing their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Pity, and Compaſſion towards the Poor; and gives the Poor occaſion of exerciſing their Faith and Truſt in God for ſupplies of Neceſſaries; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, Humility, Contentment with their mean condition, quiet ſubmiſſion to the good pleaſure of God in thus dealing with them, and thankfulneſs to God for thoſe helps and aſſiſtances which he is pleaſed to reach forth to them by the hands of thoſe with whom he depoſited more of the things of this World, on purpoſe that they might be helpful to thoſe who have leſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath been pleaſed to put this difference between men in regard of the neceſſity there is of different Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Conditions, different Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Imployments for procuring and carrying on the good and welfare of the Community of Mankind. Some muſt govern, and others muſt be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; or elſe we ſhall quickly be ruined, and all things will run into
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:61506:128"/>confuſion. Some muſt labour in the Field, others muſt grinde at the Mill, others handle the Diſtaff; ſome muſt be imployed in meaner, other in higher Services, in order whereunto it was fit that men's conditions ſhould be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thoſe Imployments in which they are to be ſerviceable to God and their Generation.</p>
            <p>Now the Application of what hath been ſpoken, follows; and this will concern all. I ſhall firſt ſpeak to the Rich, and then to the Poor. As for the Rich, or thoſe whom God hath been pleaſed to intruſt with a larger portion of Temporal things, they may hence be minded of their Duty ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways. If the Rich and the Poor meet together in all thoſe reſpects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and God be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of them all, both as men, and as conſidered under the different Adjuncts of Riches and Poverty; then may the Rich hence be cautioned and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not to deſpiſe the Poor. This is that which men who even wallow
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:61506:128"/>in plenty, and abound with the good things of this Life, are very ſubject to. A poor man is many times a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible thing in their eyes; and as he hath occaſion to come near them, he ſcarce meets with thoſe civilities from them that are due to Mankind. And uſually none are more faulty this way, than ſuch as have the greateſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to civility and condeſcenſion; I mean ſuch as were not long ſince in a mean condition themſelves, and have but newly been advanced to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Station. But theſe, and whoſoever elſe may be blame-worthy in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſhould conſider what hath above been diſcourſed of.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the pooreſt and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn Creature who is moſt deſpicable in their eyes, hath as noble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Soul as they have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or as the greateſt Potentate in the World hath; and as for his very Body, though cloathed with naſty Rags, the exquiſite Workmanſhip thereof is no leſs admirable than that of his that is cloathed with Scarlet, and adorned with Gold and Pearls, and whatever
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:61506:129"/>Nature or Art could contribute to make it beautiful and lovely.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That the pooreſt man in the World is as dear to God as they are, and as much under the Care and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Providence of God; for fine Cloaths, and Riches, and Honours, commend no man to God; high and low, rich and poor are alike to him; for he <hi>is no reſpecter of perſons;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 10.34.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he rate or value any man according to theſe things. 'Tis grace and holineſs that he looks after, and accordingly proportions his eſteem for men. <hi>The Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth; man looketh upon the outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but the Lord looketh upon the heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous,</hi> Pſal. 34.15. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him, in thoſe that hope in his mercy,</hi> Pſal. 147.11. But as for wicked and ungodly men, of what rank or quality ſoever they may be in this World, the Lord hates and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors them.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 5.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) They ſhould conſider, that the pooreſt man in all the World is as capable of being admitted to the bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:61506:129"/>Viſion and Fruition of God in the World to come, is as capable of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and eternal happineſs, as the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. As God hath given the ſame Rational and Immortal Soul to Rich and Poor, whereby they are both ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the ſight and enjoyment of God; ſo hath Chriſt died for both, and paid the ſame invaluable price for the Redemption of both; and ſo he hath commanded his Goſpel to be publiſhed alike to both, and therein the ſame terms of Salvation to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently propounded to the one and the other. There is not one Goſpel for the Rich, and another for the Poor; nor are the terms of peace with God, and reconciliation to him, more eaſy and favourable for the one than for the other. The Goſpel puts no difference between men with reference to thoſe different circumſtances as to outward things, under which they may be. It ſpeaks the ſame Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to all; <hi>Go into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he that believeth not ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> Mark 16.15, 16. <hi>Without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61506:130"/>no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all periſh,</hi> Luke 13.3. <hi>Except ye be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ye ſhall not enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 18.3.</p>
            <p>Now if God values the Souls of Rich and Poor alike, hath taken the ſame care of, and made the ſame proviſion for the Salvation of both; if Rich and Poor meet together, ſtand both upon even ground, and are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equal terms, as to the matters that are of higheſt importance and everlaſting concernment to the one and the other; ſhould any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his poor Brother upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe temporal things, theſe poor and worthleſs trifles that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy as good as nothing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Rich may hence be cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, Not to count the Poor a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or heavy burthen to them; I mean the honeſt, ſober, humble, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and induſtrious Poor. As for wicked, looſe, idle, and unprofitable Perſons, whether they be Poor or Rich, they are not only a grievance, but the very Peſts of the places where they live, as expoſing them to God's
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61506:130"/>wrath, and drawing down his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon themſelves and others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. While you count the Poor a grievance, and think how much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier the World would be if all men were Rich as you are, you forget that the Rich ſtand in need of the Poor, and could not ſubſiſt without them. Though you had ſuch a Maſs of Treaſure as you could wallow in Gold and Silver, yet theſe Metals could not clothe you; neither could you feed and live upon them; Gold and Silver would neither quench your thirſt, nor ſatisfie your hunger. You are beholding to the labour of the Poor man's hands for your Raiment and your Diet, as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis a great advantage that you have the Poor among you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually before your eyes, to make you the more thankful for that plenty that God hath bleſſed you withal (as hath alſo been ſaid),
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7.</note> 
               <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another?</hi> as the Apoſtle puts the queſtion in another caſe. Why had not he that laſt cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:61506:131"/>a Bit of Bread at your Door, been the Rich man, and you the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar? Why had not he been in your room, and you in his? Why had not he been Arrayed in your Silk and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and you clad in his Rags? Can you look upon him, and reflect on your ſelf without a deep ſenſe of his moſt free and undeſerved Bounty to you, who is the Maker of Rich and Poor, and of his own good pleaſure alone hath put this difference between you and your Poor Neighbour? The advantage of this kindly Incentive and Spur to thankfulneſs, you owe to the Poverty of your Brother. Beſides, as the beholding of his Poverty makes you more thankful for your abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, ſo it helps you to reliſh your good things the better, and puts a ſweetneſs into them which you would not have taſted, unleſs your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wants had been as ſauce to your full Diſhes to make them ſavoury to you. So you are beholding to him not only for your Meat, but for your Sauce alſo.</p>
            <pb n="245" facs="tcp:61506:131"/>
            <p n="3">3. The Poor that live among you, afford you a rich opportunity of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and imploying that which God hath put into your hand to the beſt advantage. Were it not for the Poor, you would want an object on which to exerciſe your Charity and Compaſſions, and ſo you would loſe much of your comfort here, and a great part of your reward hereafter. What comforts, what inward ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions and contents there are in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to the diſtreſſed, he only knows who hath with humility and ſincerity much exerciſed himſelf that way. He who hath been much in that Duty, can upon his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſubſcribe to that of our Saviour, that 'tis a <hi>more bleſſed</hi> thing <hi>to give than to receive.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.35</note> But beſides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comforts that are to be enjoyed in the right performance of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is moreover the reward hereafter, which God hath graciouſly promiſed, and will not fail to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow. As a man ſoweth here, ſo ſhall he reap hereafter;
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 96.</note> 
               <hi>He that ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bountifully, ſhall reap bountifully.</hi> He ſhall be fully recompenced for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:61506:132"/>he hath done of this nature at the <hi>Reſurrection of the juſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 14.14.</note> And this ſo exactly and punctually, that not ſo much as a Cup of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given to a Diſciple in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall be unrewarded.</p>
            <p>What other improvement of your Riches comparable with this, can you poſſibly make? Imploy them how you will any other way for your Temporal Advantage, they will no longer ſtand you in ſtead than while your abode ſhall be here; when Death comes, all is gone; you muſt then leave whatſoever you have laid together and heaped up; and you muſt go as naked out of this World as you came into it, excepting only your Winding-ſheet and Coffin; that's all you can carry hence, and that alſo to moulder into duſt together with your ſelf. But now the Poor give you an opportunity of making that uſe of Riches that ſhall abound to your account another day, and ſo in effect you carry them along with you into the other World.</p>
            <pb n="247" facs="tcp:61506:132"/>
            <p n="3">3. Seeing the Rich and Poor meet together in ſo many reſpects; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is the Maker of them both; and ſeeing 'tis by his moſt wiſe and gracious Providence that there ſhould be ſuch different Ranks and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, that ſome ſhould be full, and others empty, ſome ſhould abound, and others be in want; let the Rich be hence cautioned not to oppreſs the Poor.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This were a foul and wretched abuſe of thoſe Advantages in Power and Wealth, which God hath graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly afforded them above their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This were horrid unthankfulneſs to God, who hath been pleaſed out of his free Goodneſs and Bounty to put ſuch a difference between them and others.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) This were directly contrary to the deſign of God, in beſtowing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one a larger Portion of theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals than another, which was, that he that hath much, might be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:61506:133"/>and beneficial to him that hath little, and not that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be the better enabled to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and cruſh his needy and diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Brother. God hath made no man ſtrong, that he might puſh at thoſe that are weaker; nor hath he made any man Rich, that he might by his Wealth and Riches imperiouſly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineer over and trample on his Poor Neighbour. Neither may the Rich man be emboldened to oppreſs his poor Brother, becauſe he is weak and unable to make reſiſtance. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker he is, and the more unable to defend or right himſelf, the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe it is to meddle with him: For God himſelf hath undertaken to ſtand by, and help thoſe who have no power to help themſelves. Take heed what you do in taking Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Poor man's weakneſs to injure and oppreſs him. Are you not aware, that while you abuſe your Wealth and Power to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of your weak Brother, and think you may do as you liſt with him that hath no might to oppoſe you, or defend himſelf againſt you;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:61506:133"/>you have to do with God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Liſts with him, who hath ſaid, <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, and for the ſighing of the needy will I ariſe to ſet him in ſafety from him that puffeth at him,</hi> Pſal. 12.5. <hi>Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth the poor from him that is too ſtrong for him, yea the poor and needy from him that ſpoileth him,</hi> Pſal. 35.10? If you love your ſelf, and would conſult your own peace and ſafety, meddle not with God, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you do in oppreſſing your poor and impotent Brother. Take <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Counſel, who ſaith, <hi>Rob not the poor becauſe he is poor, neither op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the afflicted in the gate; for the Lord will plead their cauſe, and ſpoil the ſoul of thoſe that ſpoiled them,</hi> Prov. 22.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Now the Poor may be oppreſſed many ways; I ſhall only at preſent give two inſtances thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Rich may oppreſs the Poor by denying them thoſe helps which of right belong to them, or by divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to other uſes than that which was
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:61506:134"/>originally by the Bounty of Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors intended and deſigned for their relief. This were an horrible and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sin; this were no better than removing the old Land-mark, and entring into the Field of the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, which <hi>Solomon</hi> would have no man ſo hardy as to attempt, becauſe <hi>their redeemer is mighty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23.10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>and he will plead their cauſe.</hi> You who have the diſpoſing of the Poors-money, take heed you derive not upon you the guilt of this ſin; a ſin of that heinous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as that it were enough to ſet a whole Town on Fire, and turn it into Aſhes; look to it therefore, and ſee that the Charity of Benefactors run in its own proper Channel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Poor may be oppreſſed by the Rich, in dealing rigorouſly and unmercifully with them, and uſing them hardly in thoſe things in which they make uſe of their labour. To enforce them to do their work upon ſuch pitiful terms, as that all which they can get by their utmoſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will hardly buy them Bread to keep them alive, while you raiſe your
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:61506:134"/>ſelves, and grow Rich upon their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant Labours, is certainly in God's account no better than Oppreſſion, a ſin which may juſtly bring the Curſe of God upon your Eſtates. If there ſhould be any here that are concerned, I would earneſtly requeſt them to conſider ſeriouſly of it. If upon enquiry you ſhould find you have been guilty of this kind of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, you may well look upon it as one of thoſe things for which God hath had a Controverſy with you, and puniſhed you, by ſnatching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you what had been ſo heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. And let me further lay theſe things before you to be pondered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To take advantage of poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Neceſſities, and make them part with their Work at any rate, becauſe they muſt have Bread for themſelves and theirs, or ſtarve, is that meaſure which you would not ſhould be made you, if you were in their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Suppoſe your ſelf to be in their condition, and they in yours; would you not then think it very hard meaſure to be ſo dealt with?</p>
            <pb n="252" facs="tcp:61506:135"/>
            <p n="2">2. Though allowing them for their Labour ſo much as might make their Livelihood a little better, you would gain ſo much the leſs, yet you would have much more comfort in what is ſo gotten, were it never ſo little. 'Tis but an uncomfortable thing for any man to grow Rich by pinching the Poor.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You would be ſure to have the Bleſſing of God, and not his Curſe, upon what is ſo gotten, be it more or leſs. I beſeech you let this be written upon the Table of your Heart, let it be deeply ingraven there as a certain Truth, an unqueſtionable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which can never fail you, That in the Concluſion you ſhall be never the poorer for uſing Poor people well; and you ſhall be never the Richer for having uſed them hardly.</p>
            <p>Having hitherto ſpoken to the Rich, I come now to ſpeak a few words to the Poor, who may alſo from what hath been ſaid, be minded of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeveral ways.</p>
            <pb n="253" facs="tcp:61506:135"/>
            <p>Do the Rich and Poor meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do they both ſtand upon even ground, and are they upon equal terms, as in many other reſpects before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? So more eſpecially as to their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Concernments are the Poor, the Loweſt, the Meaneſt, and the moſt Contemptible amongſt them, as much the Objects of God's Care, and of his gracious Providence, as the Rich; even as thoſe among the Rich, the height and ſplendor of whoſe condition in the World have made them Objects of the Envy of all their Inferiours. Are the pooreſt, even ſuch as are clothed in Rags, in as fair a way for Heaven, and as capable of Grace here, and Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as the greateſt Princes, as the moſt Illuſtrious and Renowned Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates in the World; Then let the Poor hence learn, not to be diſcouraged, much leſs give way to murmuring and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Providence of God, that has put ſuch a difference between them and their Superiors, as to the things of this World. It has ſeemed good to the Wiſdom of God to place them below, while others are ſeated above; to make their condition mean and deſpicable,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:61506:136"/>while the conditions of others hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them honourable, and even ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the eyes of the inferior World. But ſeeing the Poor and the Rich meet together, and are in equal condition as to the beſt, the moſt excellent, and the moſt deſirable things; What good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there why they ſhould not be well contented with their condition, and be moſt thankful unto God for it? What reaſon have they to juſtify their envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Rich and Honourable, ſeeing they themſelves are no way inferior to them, and come no way ſhort of them as to thoſe things which are of greateſt value, and of higheſt importance?</p>

            <p>IN this Chapter we have a brief Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Reign of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> from the Beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the 20th Verſe. This <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was the Son of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> a moſt wicked
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:61506:138"/>Son, though deſcending from a moſt pious and religious Father. I ſay, a moſt wicked Son, for ſuch he was till God was pleaſed to humble him, and work a Change in him. He that ſhall read the Account that is here, and in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. given of the former Part of his Reign, and compare it with the worſt of all the Kings that went before him, ſhall find that in all manner of abominable Wickedneſs he exceeded them all: His Sins were of a moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Nature; Idolatry, Witchcraft, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with Wizards, and ſuch as had familiar Spirits; his cauſing his own Son to be burnt in way of Sacrifice to his Idols; his barbarous Cruelty in ſhedding innocent Blood in that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that he filled <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with it from one End to the other. Moreover, as theſe his Sins were hainous and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in their own Nature, ſo were the Aggravations of them ſuch, as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or higher could not eaſily be. Theſe Aggravations hath the Spirit of God in the Hiſtory mentioned, and in a ſpecial manner inſiſted on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he wrought all this Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, notwithſtanding the good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that his Father <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:61506:138"/>given him,
<note place="margin">2 Kings 21.3. 2 Chron. 33.3. 2 Kings 21.4.</note> by his Zeal againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; <hi>That he built up again the high Places which his Father had deſtroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he built Altars in the Houſe of the Lord, of which the Lord had ſaid, In</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>will I put my Name.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> 
               <hi>That he ſet a graven Image of the Grove that he had made in the Houſe which God hath choſen to place his Name therein for ever.</hi> It had been an horrible Sin, if he had only built his Altars, and ſet his Images any where elſe; how much more to ſet them up in the Houſe of God, the Place which God made ſuch account of, and ſo highly eſteemed; that he ſhould ſet up his Idols in that Place, as it were in Defiance of God, and of his Worſhip there?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he ſhould not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have offered other Sacrifices to his Idols, unleſs he had alſo offered his own Son in Sacrifice, and cauſed him to paſs through the Fire.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he did worſe than thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God deſtroyed, and caſt out before them for their Sins; that the fearful Examples of God's Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them ſhould not deter him from committing the ſame and greater Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
            <pb n="260" facs="tcp:61506:139"/>
            <p>If you demand how this could be; how it was poſſible that <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> ſhould do worſe than thoſe Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that were caſt out and deſtroyed for their Sins?</p>
            <p>I anſwer; (1.) <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had thoſe Means of Grace which thoſe Heathen Nations never injoyed. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People ſinned againſt that Light which was never vouchſafed the <hi>Amorites;</hi> and this did not a little heighten their Sins.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> erected more Images and Idols than the <hi>Amorites</hi> had. The ſeveral Nations in <hi>Canaan</hi> generally kept themſelves to thoſe particular Gods which they called their own; but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> multiplied his Idols.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Thoſe Nations were not wont to change their ſuppoſed Gods, but ſtrictly adhered to them: Thus did not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> and his People; and in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their Idolatry was worſe than that of the Heathen, as God by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſets it forth, and aggravates it; <hi>Hath a Nation changed their Gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 2.11.</note> 
               <hi>which are yet no Gods? But my People have changed their Glory for that which doth not profit.</hi> The Gods of thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Nations were no Gods, and yet
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:61506:139"/>thoſe Nations would not caſt them off, and take up other Gods; they ſtuck and adhered to them ſtedfaſtly and reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and would not exchange them for the true God: but <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People forſook the only true and living God that made the Heavens, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to the Worſhip and Service of falſe Gods; they changed their Glory (for ſuch was the true God to them, while they owned him alone, and cleaved to him) they changed their Glory for them that were no Gods, but the Work of Mens Hands. In theſe Reſpects <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did worſe than the Heathen.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another Aggravation of his Sin was, that whereas the ſhedding the Blood of one innocent Perſon had been a crying Sin, he ſhed it at ſuch a rate, that he filled <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with innocent Blood from one End to the other; there was no Part of that great City where the Blood of innocent Perſons that had been cauſleſly ſpilt, was not to be ſeen, and where the Cry of it might not be heard: So great and ſo hainous were this Man's Sins, and ſo high were the Aggravations of them.</p>
            <p>Now in the Words which I have read,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:61506:140"/>we are informed how God was pleaſed to deal with him; what Courſes he took to reclaim him and his People; and what was the Effect thereof upon him and them. This in the General.</p>
            <p>More particularly in the Words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>In the Words we have;</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. God's great Mercy to him and his People, in calling them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and in giving them warning of approaching Judgments in caſe they ſhould ſtill perſevere in their Sins and Impenitency. The Lord ſpake unto <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and to his People, as 'tis here briefly expreſs'd, but more fully in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>The Lord ſpake by his Servants the Prophets, ſaying, Becauſe</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>King of</hi> Judah <hi>hath done theſe Abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the</hi> Amorites <hi>did, which were before him, and had made</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah <hi>alſo to ſin with his Idols: Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Behold, I am bringing ſuch Evil upon</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>that whoſoever heareth of it, both his Ears ſhall tingle. And I will ſtretch over</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>the Line of</hi> Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, <hi>and the Plummet of the Houſe of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liab; <hi>and I will wipe</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>as a
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:61506:140"/>Man wipeth a Diſh, wiping it, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it upſide down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We have the Obſtinacy and Impenitency of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they would not hearken.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We have an Account of that further Courſe which God took with <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> in order to his reclaiming, when gracious Calls and Invitations to Repentance, and Warnings of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments, would not prevail: <hi>The Lord brought upon them the Captains of the Hoſt of the King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>which took</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>among the Thorns, and bound him with Fetters, and carried him to</hi> Babylon.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. We have an Account of the Effect which this ſevere Courſe had upon <hi>Manaſſeh:</hi> When he was in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. We have the Iſſue of his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himſelf, ſeeking God, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: God was intreated of him, and heard his Supplication, and brought him again to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <pb n="264" facs="tcp:61506:141"/>
            <p n="6">6thly. We are informed what <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> gained, or what he learned by all this; <hi>Then</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>knew that the Lord he was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeak of theſe Particulars in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have in the Words God's great Mercy to <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People, in calling them to Repentance, and giving them Warning of approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in caſe they ſhould ſtill perſiſt obſtinately and impenitently in their ſinful Courſes. This gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Dealing of God with <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People may afford us theſe two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>That God is graciouſly pleaſed to call and invite Sinners to Repentance, and to give them Warnings of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are hanging over their Heads, before he brings his Judgments upon them.</hi> This is the uſual Courſe of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; he is not wont to ſurprize Men with his Judgments before he gives them any notice of the Danger they are in; but he firſt warns them, calls them to Repentance, and threatens them if they ſhall ſtill continue in their Impenitency; and when all his Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61506:141"/>are ſlighted, then he ſtrikes. Thus he warned the old World, and called them to Repentance by the Preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> all the while the Ark was a building. Thus by the Prophets he called the Jews to Repentance, and threatned them with the Captivity, if they repented not. Thus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf called them to Repentance; and in caſe of their Impenitency ſtill perſiſted in, threatned the utter Deſolation and Deſtruction of the Temple and City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Romans.</p>
            <p>Now the Reaſons why God is pleaſed thus to deal with Sinners; why he thus calls them to Repentance, and gives them warning before he ſtrikes, are principally theſe two.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That by their timely Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his Judgments; and that he may have no Occaſion of uſing that Severity againſt them, which if they repent not, will be neceſſary both for the Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Honour, and in order to their Humiliation and Reformation: <hi>God doth not afflict willingly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 3.33.</note> 
               <hi>nor grieve the Children of Men.</hi> He takes no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſevere Courſes, unleſs where there is a Neceſſity of them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:61506:142"/>that gentler Means do no Good.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. He gives Warning, calls to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and promiſes Mercy upon Repentance, before he ſtrikes; to the End, that if Men will take no Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if ſin they will, and perſevere ſtill in their Sins, whatever it coſts them, the Juſtice of his Proceedings againſt them may be cleared, that the Sinners themſelves may be rendred inexcuſable, and every Mouth may be ſtopped, or be enforced to acknowledg that he is righteous, even when he puniſheth them moſt ſeverely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If God be ſo gracious as to call to Repentance, and give Warnings before he ſtrikes, let us not be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at ſuch Warnings, let us not flight them or contemn them; neither let our Hearts fret or riſe againſt them, but humbly, patiently, and thankfully entertain them, and carefully improve them. If God's Deſign in them be to prevent Puniſhments, let not us by our ſlighting and diſregarding them, draw thoſe Evils upon our ſelves which they are deſigned to keep off. 'Tis a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thing not to take Warning when 'tis given us, when God gives it that he
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:61506:142"/>may bring us to Repentance by it. The Admonition that <hi>Ely</hi> gave his Sons, and the Repreſentation that he made to them of the Danger of their ſinful Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, was in effect a Warning from God: but they regarded it not; and what was the Iſſue but their Ruine? The Spirit of God ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.25.</note> 
               <hi>That they hearkned not to the Voice of their Father, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 68.21.</note> 
               <hi>God ſhall wound the Head of his Enemies, and the hairy Scalp of every one that goeth on ſtill in his Treſpaſſes.</hi> And the making good of this Threatning may They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others expect, that ſtill go on in their Treſpaſſes againſt Warnings; and eſpecially if they ſtill go on againſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Warnings.
<note place="margin">Prov. 29.1.</note> 
               <hi>He that being often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved hardneth his Neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without Remedy.</hi> Do we believe this? If we do, how ſhould we haſten to make our Peace with God; eſpecially ſuch of us as have long gone on in our Sins againſt all Warnings and Calls to Repentance? We may think perhaps that becauſe we have been long warned and threatned, and yet ſtill God holds his Hand, and forbears to ſtrike, we are in no Danger; it may be the long Patience which God
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:61506:143"/>hath exerciſed towards us, makes us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of his Warnings: and now at length we begin to make account that we may ſafely enough go on in our old Ways, there is no ſuch Danger as hath been pretended. But let us take heed how we thus abuſe the Patience and Long-ſufferance of God. Whatever our preſent Thoughts are, or how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may now flatter our ſelves, theſe two things we ſhall certainly find in the end.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That how long ſoever God may bear with us, yet he will fulfil his Threatnings in the end, unleſs by our Repentance we prevent them. Heaven and Earth ſhall rather paſs away,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.35</note> than any one Word that he hath ſpoken, ſhall fall to the Ground.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The longer God is pleaſed to bear with us, and wait for our Repentance, the more ſeverely will he handle us at laſt, if ſtill we refuſe to be reclaimed. Long-continued and abuſed Patience u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ends in Fury. <hi>I kept ſilence,</hi> ſaid God to the wicked Man, the obſtinate Sinner that would not be reclaimed; I had long Patience with him: <hi>And thou thoughteſt that I was ſuch a one as thy ſelf;</hi> My Forbearance of thee made thee
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:61506:143"/>think that I was much of thy mind, and had no great diſlike of thy evil Ways:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>But I will reprove thee, and ſet thy Sins in order before thee. Conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Though I have born long with thee, yet thou art much miſtaken if thou thinkeſt that I will always bear with thee: The longer I ſtay, the more terrible and irreſiſtible will my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be when I reckon with thee, and come upon thee at laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If God be pleaſed to call Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Repentance, and to give them Warning before he puniſhes them; then let all ſuch as are puniſhed, juſtify God, and acknowledg that they ſuffer juſtly, and that they have no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of God, but of themſelves: For having offended, and deſerved Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, God gave them Warning before he would correct them; but they would not take Warning. If they be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they may thank themſelves; they might by their Repentance have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it, but they would not.</p>
            <pb n="270" facs="tcp:61506:144"/>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. The ſame Conſideration ſhould alſo perſwade Sufferers to bear with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience what God is pleaſed to lay upon them for their Sins. They have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made themſelves Sufferers, and drawn thoſe Evils upon themſelves, which God would never have inflicted on them, if any Warnings would have made them ſenſible of their Danger, and have reclaimed them; if any Calls and Invitations to Repentance, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of Mercy would have prevailed with them, taken them off from their ſinful Courſes, and gained them. Is there not all the reaſon in the World, that they ſhould undergo with Patience thoſe Evils which they would bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, notwithſtanding all the Means which God made uſe of to keep them off?

               <hi>Thou haſt conſulted Shame to thy Houſe,</hi> ſaid God to the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> When impenitent Sinners will take no Warnings, when they will not be perſwaded to take that Courſe by which alone Puniſhments may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, they conſult Puniſhments to themſelves. Whatever a Man ſuffers, he may ſay to himſelf as God ſaid to his People,
<note place="margin">Jer. 4.18.</note> 
               <hi>Thy Way and thy Doings have
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:61506:144"/>procured theſe things unto thee.</hi> He that ſhall conſider this, cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that his Impatience under God's afflicting Hand is moſt unreaſonable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another Obſervation from God's ſpeaking to <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People, from his forewarning them of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments, and calling them to Repentance, is, <hi>That God is pleaſed to give warning to the greateſt Sinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he puniſheth them, and to call them to Repentance, that they may uſe the Means for eſcaping thoſe his Judgments, which without Repentance will inevitably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, and come upon them.</hi> Such a Sinner was <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> whoſe monſtrous Wickedneſs and horrid Abominations we have in part been acquainted with before. And as for his People, we may well ſuppoſe that they alſo were prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly wicked, and ripe for the Sickle, for the Sickle of the Wrath of God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of them muſt needs concur with <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in thoſe his Sins, and were together with him jointly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thoſe terrible Judgments that are mentioned, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. So then both <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at a fearful pitch of Wickedneſs:
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:61506:145"/>and yet as wicked as they were, God gives them fair Quarter; he warns them before he will pour out the Vials of his Wrath upon them, and calls them to Repentance, that they might not ſay when his Judgments ſhould take hold of them, that they would have repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if they had known the Danger they were in, and ſufficient Warning had been given them in ſeaſon. The Age before the Flood was deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inſomuch that it's ſaid, <hi>it repented the Lord that he had made Man on the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>and that it grieved him at the Heart:</hi> So is God pleaſed to ſet forth the Wickedneſs of Mankind in thoſe Times, ſpeaking after the manner of Men. So again 'tis afterwards ſaid, that <hi>all Fleſh had corrupted his Way upon the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 12, 13</note> 
               <hi>and that the Earth was filled with Violence.</hi> And yet tho Mankind had ſo wofully degenerated, and the World was ſo fearfully corrupted, and ſo univerſally depraved, that only eight Perſons, <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, were preſerved; yet God did not preſently ſweep them all away with the Beeſom of Deſtruction, but gave them warning of the Flood 120 Years before it came,
<note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note> and waited for their Repentance all the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:61506:145"/>while that the Ark was a preparing.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.20.</note> The Jews were deſperately wicked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Captivity, as by the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their grievous Sins, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Corruption, which we meet with in the Prophets, may be ſeen; and yet God did not immediately call for their Enemies to fall upon them, and carry them away Captives, but raiſed up and ſent them many Prophets to forewarn them of the Captivity, and call upon them for Humiliation and Reformation, that the Miſeries threatned might not come upon them. The Wickedneſs of the <hi>Ninivites</hi> was great,
<note place="margin">Jonah 1.2.</note> and came up before God; and yet God would not preſently deſtroy them, but gave them Warning by the Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> ſent to them on purpoſe, who cried and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proclaimed in the City, ſaying,
<note place="margin">Jonah 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>Yet forty Days and</hi> Niniveh <hi>ſhall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</hi> How extreamly wicked and univerſally corrupt the Jewiſh State was immediately before the coming of Chriſt, is evident from the Prophecy of <hi>Malachi,</hi> the laſt of the Prophets; and yet the fatal Day of their Viſitation did not preſently come upon them and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them; but our Saviour by his Preaching called them to Repentance,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:61506:146"/>and forewarned them of the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Miſeries at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it. Now the Reaſons of this Point are the ſame with thoſe of the former; he calls the greater Sinners to Repentance, and forewarns them of the dangerous and fearful Conſequents of their continued and final Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, that he may thereby bring them to Repentance, and prevent their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, if it may be; or that in caſe they repent not, they may be rendred inexcuſable, and that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Severity againſt them when he reckons with them, may be juſtified and cleared.</p>
            <p>But you may here object againſt what hath been ſaid; Doth not God often ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize wicked Men with his Judgments? Doth not his Wrath fall upon them on a ſudden many times, and when they leaſt fear it? Doth it not often take hold of them in the height of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Security, and when they do not ſo much as dream of any Danger they are in? And is not this to be ſuddenly and unexpectedly ſurprized by his terrible Judgments? So the Deſtruction of wicked Men cometh as a Whirl-wind;
<note place="margin">Prov. 1.27.</note> that is, both ſuddenly and irreſiſtibly.
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:61506:146"/>So Chriſt, ſpeaking of the laſt Judgment at the End of the World, ſaith, that <hi>as a Snare it ſhall come on all them that dwell on the Face of the whole Earth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 21; 35.</note> It ſhould ſuddenly and unexpectedly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them, as the Bird is ſurprized that is taken in the Snare. So again, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.2, 3.—<hi>The Day of the Lord ſo cometh as a Thief in the Night. For when they ſhall ſay, Peace and Safety, then ſudden Deſtruction cometh upon them, as Travail upon a Woman with Child; and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That theſe, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Scriptures to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are no way contrary to what hath been ſaid concerning God's giving Warning to the greateſt Sinners, and his calling to Repentance before he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That wicked Men are often ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly overtaken and ſurprized with God's terrible Judgments, is not for want of being warned, but becauſe they will not take Warning: Though they be told from Day to Day of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God that ſeem to be even at the Door, and ready to light upon them, yet they will not believe it; and ſo whenſoever the Judgments of God come
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:61506:147"/>upon them, they are ſurprized; and they come when they think not of them, when they look not for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis moſt juſt with God that they who have contemned many former Warnings, and would take no Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſhould at laſt have no Warning. And this is that which is expreſly threatned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2, 3. where Chriſt ſpeaking to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things that are ready to die, for I have not found thy Works perfect before God: Remember therefore how thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and heard, and hold faſt and repent.</hi> Here is Warning ſufficient: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt not watch, <hi>I will come on thee as a Thief, and thou ſhalt not know what Hour I will come upon thee.</hi> That is in Effect, If thou wilt take no Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when I at length come upon thee to puniſh thee, thou ſhalt have no Warning. And ſo much by way of Anſwer to that Objection.</p>
            <p>Now to apply very briefly what hath been ſaid concerning this Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If God be graciouſly pleaſed to call the greateſt Sinners to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to give them Warning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:61506:147"/>he puniſheth them, then have the greateſt Sinners abundant Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come in to God, and to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make their Peace with him, how long ſoever they have ſtood out againſt him: They may be ſure God would never call them to repent, and invite them to come in to him, unleſs he were moſt willing to entertain them, and bid them welcome when they come. Far be it from you to harbour ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and diſhonourable Thoughts of God, as if he would invite you to come in to him, and then reject you and caſt you off when you do come. Whatever your Sins have been, they ſhall not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your being reconciled to him, and your making your Peace with him, if at length you lay down your Arms that you have taken up againſt him, and caſt your ſelf upon his Mercy. But then,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. You muſt do it ſincerely and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially; you may not dally with God, pretending to lay down your Arms to Day, and taking them up again to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. If you expect to find Mercy with him, you muſt return to him with your whole Heart, and not feignedly.</p>
            <pb n="278" facs="tcp:61506:148"/>
            <p n="2">2dly. You muſt come in to him ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you muſt do it immediately. He that ſaith he will repent hereafter, he will repent to Morrow, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to Day; and for ought he knows may be in another World before the Morrow cometh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If God be graciouſly pleaſed to call the greateſt Sinners to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; then let us not utterly deſpair of any whom God calls; let us not be diſcouraged from uſing Means for the Converſion of any, for whoſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion God is ſtill uſing Means; let us not be weary of waiting for the Converſion of any, for whoſe Converſion God is ſtill waiting.</p>
            <p>There are two things that in this Caſe uſually diſcourage us, and make us weary of uſing Means for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of Sinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. If Means have been long uſed, and no Good hath been done upon them, no Change for the better hath appeared in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. If, as ſometimes it is, the Means that have been made uſe of for reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and reducing them from the Error of their ways, have made them
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:61506:148"/>worſe, more obdurate, more obſtinate, more oppoſite to what is offered them, and laid before them for their Good. When thus it is, we are very apt to ſay, To what Purpoſe ſhould any further Indeavours be uſed for gaining them who will not be gained, and on whom all Labour that is beſtowed is loſt? But notwithſtanding all this, if God be ſtill pleaſed to call upon them to return, though they turn the deaf Ear to all his Calls, why ſhould we think it much to be ſtill calling on them? Though they hitherto ſtop their Ears, yet God can bore and open their Ears when he pleaſeth; and we know not but that he may yet ſhew Mercy to them in conquering them and ſubduing them to himſelf by his Grace, how long ſoever and how obſtinately ſoever they have perſiſted in their Impenitency: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us go on to do our Duty in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their reclaiming, and let God do what ſeemeth good in his Eyes.</p>
            <p>So I have done with the firſt Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in the Text; God's great Mercy to <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People that had ſo highly provoked him; he was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to call them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to give them Warning of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:61506:149"/>thoſe Evils that were approaching, and would certainly overtake them, and come upon them if they ſhould ſtill perſevere in their ſinful Courſes. How much ſoever they had provoked him, he would not bring his Judgments upon them till he had firſt dealt with them by his Prophets, to make them ſenſible of their Danger, and to bring them to Repentance.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the ſecond Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the Impenitency and Obſtinacy of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People; <hi>They would not hearken.</hi> 'Tis not ſaid, They did not hearken, but <hi>they would not hearken.</hi> Which Words imply a wilful diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rejecting of thoſe Admonitions, Reproofs and Warnings that were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Whence we may obſerve;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That wicked Men that have long gone on in a Courſe of Sin, come ſometimes to that Degree of Obſtinacy and Hardneſs of Heart, that no Calls or Invitations to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, no Warnings of impending and approaching Judgments will work upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This their Obſtinacy is many ways ſet forth and repreſented to us in the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:61506:149"/>holy Scriptures. The Pſalmiſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares ſuch wicked Men to <hi>the deaf Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſtoppeth her Ears,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 58.4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>and will not hearken to the Voice of the Charmer, charming never ſo wiſely:</hi> The meaning is, nothing can be ſo fitly ſpoken, but that they refuſe to hearken to it. And as they ſtop their Ears, ſo they cloſe their Eyes; <hi>When thy Hand is lifted up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 26.11.</note> 
               <hi>they will not ſee.</hi> So of the perverſe and obſtinate Jews that lived in the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi>'s time, 'tis ſaid,
<note place="margin">Zech. 7.11, 12.</note> that <hi>they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to hearken, and pulled away the Shoulder, and ſtopped their Ears, that they ſhould not hear: Yea, they made their Hearts as an Adamant Stone.</hi> Of this Unteachableneſs and Obſtinacy of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit God complains, ſaying,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.11</note> 
               <hi>My People would not hearken to my Voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me.</hi> To the ſame Effect is that moſt affectionate Speech of our Saviour, <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem,
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.37.</note> 
               <hi>how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not?</hi> Yea ſometimes ſo far are wicked Men from hearkning to thoſe gracious Calls and merciful Invitations to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which God vouchſafeth them, that they cannot endure any Man that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:61506:150"/>ſhall indeavour to make them ſenſible of their evil Ways, and to withdraw them from their Sins. Upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it was that <hi>Ahab</hi> counted <hi>Elijah</hi> his Enemy:
<note place="margin">2 Kings 21.20.</note> 
               <hi>Haſt thou found me, O mine Enemy?</hi> ſaid he, when the Prophet came to reprove him, and to denounce the Judgments of God againſt him and his Family for their Sins. And ſo impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent were ungodly Men of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s time, that they ſtudied to do what Miſchief they could to ſuch as ſhould attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them: <hi>They make a Man an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender for a Word, and lay a Snare for him that reproveth in the Gate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 29.21.</note> ſaith that Prophet. The like Complaint we have, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.10. <hi>They hate him that rebuketh in the Gate, and abhor him that ſpeaketh uprightly.</hi> Now there are ſeveral things that make wicked Men the more obſtinate, and that are, if not Cauſes, yet Occaſions of their turning the deaf Ear to all thoſe Calls and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to Repentance, which God vouchſafeth them. Such as are,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Outward Proſperity. When the World ſmiles upon them, when they live at Eaſe, and injoy whatever Heart can wiſh; this through the Corruption
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:61506:150"/>of their Hearts puffs them up with Pride, and makes them ſlight whatever is offered them, or laid before them for the Good of their Souls. This ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect had outward Proſperity upon <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jachin;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 22.21.</note> 
               <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thou ſaidst, I will not hear.</hi> To the ſame Purpoſe is that of the Pſalmiſt, who ſpeaking of wicked Men, ſaith, <hi>Becauſe they have no Changes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 55.19</note> 
               <hi>therefore they fear not God.</hi> Becauſe they are not haraſſed with Afflictions, nor emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied from Veſſel to Veſſel, therefore they regard not God's Calls to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor his Threatnings: He may ſay what he pleaſeth, he may threaten them as ſeverely as he will, they are not moved at it, nor concern themſelves with it.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Another thing that makes them the more obſtinate, is, their not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Threatnings and Denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Judgments againſt them for their Sins. Thus the old World not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what God had threatned concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deſtruction of the World by the Flood, ſtill continued in their Sins, and repented not, till at length the Flood came upon them, and took them all away, excepting only thoſe few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:61506:151"/>that found Grace in the Eyes of God to be exempted from that dreadful Judgment. So though God had often by his Prophets threatned the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet the profane and obſtinate Jews putting far off the evil Day, and giving no Credit to the Threatnings, would not be brought to Repentance. Such were they whom the Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> deſcribed, who being ſetled on their Lees,
<note place="margin">Zeph. 1.12.</note> ſaid in their Hearts, <hi>The Lord will not do Good, neither will he do Evil:</hi> that is, he would neither fulfil his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, nor make good his Threatnings; they believed neither the one nor the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Another thing that makes wicked Men the more obſtinate, and that hardens them againſt all Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Calls to Repentance, is the abuſed Patience and Long-ſufferance of God towards them: Becauſe God hath long born with them, therefore they think he will always bear with them; becauſe waiting for their Repentance, he doth not ſpeedily put his Threatnings in Execution, therefore they make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he will never put them in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.11.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe Sentence against an evil Work is not executed ſpeedily; therefore
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:61506:151"/>the Heart of the Sons of Men is fully ſet in them to do Evil.</hi> If Puniſhment be but deferred and reſpited for a time, to ſee if Offenders will not bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by their Repentance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that Severity which elſe muſt be uſed againſt them, even this makes them think they are now in no Danger of being puniſhed, and ſo they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to go on in their Sins. Thus the wicked Jews incouraged themſelves in their ſinful Courſes, and in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Security, ſaying,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 12.22.</note> 
               <hi>The Days are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, and every Viſion faileth.</hi> As if they had ſaid, the Prophets terrify us with ſad Viſions, and ſevere Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Denunciations of approaching Judgments; but nothing comes of it, all their Viſions fail, and we are ſtill in Safety, and ſo we truſt we ſhall be, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Frights they would put us into.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Another thing, and indeed the chief thing that makes wicked Men ſo obſtinate as that they ſtop their Ears againſt all Solicitations and Calls to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is the moſt intire League that there is between them and their Sins: So dearly do they love their Sins, that they cannot indure to think of parting
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:61506:152"/>with them. Whatever can be ſaid to take them off from their Sins, is of no Account, ſignifies nothing with them; injoy their Sins they will, whatever comes of it: They are perfectly deaf to all Charmings that tend to the making a Separation between them and their Luſts. Thus were the Jews ſo ſondly in love with the idolatrous Services of foreign Nations, that after them they would, nothing ſhould withhold them: <hi>I have loved Strangers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 2.25.</note> ſaith <hi>Judah, and after them will I go.</hi> Now to apply ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briefly what hath been ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If wicked Men that have long gone on in a Courſe of Sin, may and do ſometimes come to ſuch a Degree of Obſtinacy and Hardneſs of Heart, that no Admonitions, no Reproofs, no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations or Calls to Repentance, no Warnings of approaching Judgments will work upon them, then let no Man that treats with Men about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of their Souls, think it ſtrange if he ſometimes meet with ſuch Men. The World is full of ſuch Men, and ever hath been. The Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and our Saviour Chriſt himſelf,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:61506:152"/>had to do with ſuch Men: And theſe later Ages of the World are not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, What's to be done when we meet with ſuch Men? Muſt we let them alone, becauſe as far as we can ſee, they are ſuch as hate Inſtruction, and caſt the Words of God behind their back, as the wicked Man is deſcribed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.17.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, No. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We know not Mens Hearts; and therefore though they ſeem to be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and incorrigible, yet there may be ſome Convictions within, and ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Relentings that we cannot diſcern.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they ſhould really be as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and incorrigible as they ſeem to be, and much worſe, yet God can work upon them, and change their Hearts, if he pleaſe. No Heart is ſo hard but he can ſoften it; no Heart is ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate but he can ſubdue it. Wherefore God laid an expreſs Charge upon <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> to ſpeak to a perverſe and obſtinate People, though in all Probability his Labour would be loſt upon them: Thou Son of Man <hi>ſhalt ſpeak my Words unto them, whether they will hear,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. That 'tis a thing moſt pleaſing and acceptable to God, when a Man is not regardleſs of what he ſpeaks, but ſeriouſly minds it, takes it to Heart, and is affected with it. <hi>To this Man will I look,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 66.2.</note> ſaith he, <hi>even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and that trembleth at my Word.</hi> A moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Inſtance of the gracious Reſpect that God hath to this Frame of Spirit, is that which is recorded in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:61506:155"/>There we find that when <hi>Shaphan</hi> the Scribe had read the Book of the Law, that had been found in the Houſe of the Lord, before <hi>Joſiah</hi> the King, and all the Curſes and Threatnings contained therein, as we may ſuppoſe; <hi>Joſiah</hi> took it ſo to Heart, that he rent his Clothes, and ſent immediately to enquire of the Lord for himſelf, for the People, and for all <hi>Judah,</hi> concerning the Words of the Book: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he,
<note place="margin">Ver. 11, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>great is the Wrath of the Lord that is kindled againſt us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Fathers have not hearkned to the Words of this Book, to do according to all that is written therein concerning us.</hi> So deeply was <hi>Joſiah</hi> affected with what God had threatned againſt that People for their Sins. But now how did God take it at his Hands, that he was thus affected? This you may ſee in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which <hi>Huldah</hi> the Propheteſs, of whom he enquired, returned him at <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20. where ſhe having aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that People, that whatſoever Evils God had threatned ſhould certainly come upon them, ſhe adds, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a very gracious Anſwer from the Lord: <hi>But to the King of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah <hi>which ſent you to enquire of the Lord, thus ſhall ye ſay to him,</hi> ſaith ſhe; <hi>Thus
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:61506:156"/>ſaith the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>As touching the VVords which thou haſt heard; becauſe thine Heart was tender, and thou haſt humbled thy ſelf before the Lord, when thou heardeſt what I ſpake againſt this Place, and againſt the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they ſhould become a Deſolation and a Curſe; and haſt rent thy Clothes, and wept before me; I alſo have heard thee, ſaith the Lord: Behold therefore I will gather thee unto thy Fathers, and thou ſhalt be gathered into thy Grave in Peace, and thine Eyes ſhall not ſee all the Evil which I will bring upon this Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, that to ſtop a Man's Ears, and to harden a Man's Heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Counſels, Admonitions and Warnings, as God is pleaſed to give him, is a thing highly diſpleaſing to him, as from the Scriptures afore-cited appears.</p>
            <p>I now go on to the third Particular in my Text, the Courſe which God was further pleaſed to take with <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in order to his reclaiming, when gracious Calls and Invitations to Repentance, and Warnings of approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not prevail. The Lord brought upon them the Captains of the Hoſt of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which took
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:61506:156"/>
               <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> among the Thorns, and bound him with Fetters, and carried him to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That when other Means prove ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for the reclaiming of impenitent and obſtinate Sinners, God is pleaſed to make uſe of Afflictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, God can effectually reclaim and convert the moſt ſtubborn and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, the moſt obdurate and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Sinners without Afflictions. He needs not take the Rod in hand to do his Work upon them. He that made Hearts, can remake them; he can change and renew them when he pleaſeth, and how he pleaſeth. He can do it by Means, and he can do it without Means. He can create and infuſe Grace in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; he can in the twinkling of an Eye, without the Intervention or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of any created Inſtrument, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the filthieſt, the moſt loathſom and abominable Sinner into a Saint, a Devil into an Angel of Light. There is nothing too hard for him, who being Omnipotent, can do whatſoever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. But yet however, ordinarily he makes uſe of Afflictions for humbling and reclaiming obſtinate Sinners, when
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:61506:157"/>other Means prevail not. And ſeeing he doth make uſe of Afflictions, we muſt conclude that he judgeth that the beſt and fitteſt Courſe, for otherwiſe he would not make choice of it. We may perhaps in favour to our ſelves, be apt to think this great Work might be much better effected without Afflictions. Our carnal Wiſdom may apprehend that it would more conduce to the exalting and magnifying of God's Power and Goodneſs, if this great Work of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and renewing the Hearts of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sinners were effected by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Hand of God, and the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Operation of his Spirit on the Heart, without the Suffering, the Smart, or Durance of the Sinner. But alas! who are we that we ſhould preſume to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our fooliſh Reaſonings againſt his Infinite Wiſdom? Whatever our dark, ſelfiſh and partial Reaſon may ſuggeſt to the contrary, that muſt needs be the beſt and fitteſt Courſe that could be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken which God hath pitched on: no better Courſe could be thought on, no wiſer Method could be deviſed for bringing Sinners to Repentance, and for working a Change in them, than that which he hath made choice of. When
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61506:157"/>we have conſidered the Matter, this we muſt of neceſſity grant, unleſs we will make our ſelves wiſer than God, unleſs we will take upon us to dictate and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to him a better way than he hath contrived.</p>
            <p>Now for the Proof and Confirmation of this Point, that God is pleaſed to make uſe of Afflictions for the reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of obſtinate Sinners, when other Means prevail not, I need not ſay much; our own Experience is a ſufficient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation thereof. There is no Man that hath obſerved God's Dealings with the Sons of Men, but muſt have taken notice that nothing is more ordinary in the Courſe of God's Providence, than to bring them home to himſelf by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, who will not otherwiſe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Error of their ways. And as he takes this Courſe with wicked Men to convert them, ſo he takes the ſame Courſe with his Children to recal them, and to bring them into the right way again when they have gone aſtray. This was the Courſe which he took with <hi>David,</hi> as he himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.67.</note> 
               <hi>Before I was afflicted I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, but now I keep thy Word.</hi> And again;
<note place="margin">Ver. 71.</note> 
               <hi>It is good for me that I have been
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:61506:158"/>afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> He means, that he might ſo learn God's Statutes as to practiſe them, and frame his Life and Converſation according to them.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this Truth briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If God be pleaſed to make uſe of Afflictions for reclaiming and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Sinners, when other Means will not prevail; then if Men be wiſe, and if they would prevent and keep off Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, it concerns them to improve thoſe other Means which God makes uſe of; I mean, Inſtructions, Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Reproofs and Warnings, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves for their Sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their Lives, that ſo God may not bring thoſe Afflictions upon them which will be grievous to them. What Folly and Madneſs is it when Men will put God to lay ſore and grievous things upon them, becauſe they will not be wrought upon by gentler Means? <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Prov. 17.10.</note> 
               <hi>A Reproof entreth more into a wiſe Man, than an hundred Stripes into a Fool.</hi> So then in the Judgment of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> he is a wiſe Man into whom a Reproof enters; that is, on whom it
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:61506:158"/>makes Impreſſions, and by whom it is entertained and improved:
<note place="margin">Prov. 12.1.</note> but <hi>he that hateth Reproof is brutiſh.</hi> He is ſo far from being a wiſe Man, that he is ſcarce a Man; he is more like a Brute than a Man; he underſtands not his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which is to take Reproofs to Heart, to be affected with them, and to make a good Uſe of them, and not by rejecting them to draw thoſe Evils upon himſelf which he might avoid if he would. Conſider this, you that are now admoniſhed, reproved and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but will not hearken: Do you know what you do? As much as in you lies, you put the Rod into God's Hand to correct you ſeverely, and to make you ſmart ſorely, to try if that Courſe may not take better Effect upon you than thoſe milder Courſes which he hath hitherto taken with you. Why ſhould you conſult and procure Sorrow, Sufferings and Smart to your ſelf? How much better had it been for <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> to have hearkned to the Meſſage of the Lord, brought to him by the Prophets, and not by his Diſobedience and Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy to have procured the Captains of the Hoſt of the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to be ſent againſt him, <hi>to bind him with Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:61506:159"/>and carry him to</hi> Babylon? When we ſuffer for our Sins, then we condemn and cry out againſt our ſelves, that we ſhould be ſo fooliſhly obſtinate as not to hearken to good Counſel when time was, whereby we might have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Sufferings. But ſo it is, that in things of this Nature we ſeldom learn Wit till we have bought it, and paid dearly for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If God be pleaſed to make uſe of Afflictions to reclaim and reduce Sinners when other Means will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, then let ſuch as are afflicted be careful that they do not impatiently murmur, and fret againſt the Lord who correcteth them. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They may thank themſelves that they are corrected; they have been the Authors and Procurers of their own Sufferings. If they would have been humbled and reformed by gentler Means, there would have been no need of thoſe ſeverer Courſes which now are taken with them. God is not forward to correct; he takes no ſuch Delight in correcting, as to take the Rod in Hand when there is no need of it. He doth not afflict willingly; he never doth it
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:61506:159"/>but when there is great Cauſe for it, and our obſtinate Perſeverance in our Sins againſt all other Means makes Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have ſo little Reaſon to fret and murmur againſt God for correcting them, that they have great Cauſe to be thankful to God for his Care of them, and that he doth not leave them now to themſelves, and ſuffer them to go on in their Sins to their Ruine, ſeeing they refuſe to hearken to him, and harden their Hearts againſt all good Counſels, Admonitions, Reproofs and Warnings by which he hath ſolicited and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked them to Repentance. Having found them ſo perverſe and refractory, how juſtly might he now rid his Hands of them, look no more after them, but <hi>give them up to their own Hearts Lust;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 81.12</note> 
               <hi>and let them alone to walk in their own Counſels;</hi> as in the like Caſe he dealt with <hi>Iſrael?</hi> 'Tis an Argument of his great Love to them, that he will make Trial of all ſorts of Means whereby they may be brought to Repentance, before he will utterly caſt them off, and meddle no more with them, or concern himſelf any further about their Good.</p>

They would not be won by gentler Means, and therefore now God is trying whether his Rod may not effect that Good in them which his Word alone would not. Be not ſo obſtinate and refractory as to render all Means ineffectual which God makes uſe of for reclaiming you, as to defeat and fruſtrate the Deſign of all thoſe Methods of his Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by which you might be gained, and be brought home to him. Labour to anſwer God's End in correcting you, and be perſwaded to hear the Rod, as God by the Prophet enjoins.

If God's Chaſtiſements take you not off from your Sins; if no Severities will imbitter them to you, and make you willing to leave them, then what remains but that God ſhould look upon you as an incorrigible Perſon, as one whoſe Diſeaſe is incurable, and ſo leave you to periſh in your Iniquity? Thus God left <hi>Ephraim</hi> to take the Courſe which pleaſed him, when it appeared that his Heart was ſo ſet upon his Idols, that nothing would bring him out of love with them:
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 4.17.</note> Ephraim <hi>is joined to Idols, let him alone.</hi> To be thus let alone, is that indeed which wicked Men would have; they would ſtill gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their Luſts, go on in their Sins qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and not be diſturbed in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them. This is in their Account the greateſt Happineſs: but 'tis indeed the moſt dreadful Effect of God's higheſt Indignation againſt them. It were a thouſand times better, and more eligible, that all the Calamities
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:61506:161"/>and Miſeries in the World ſhould light upon a Man, than that God ſhould ſay of him, He is an obſtinate and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Sinner, he is one that will not be reformed by any thing that I have ſaid or done; wherefore let him alone, let him take his Fill of Sin, he ſhall have no more Diſturbance from me till I come to reckon with him once for all. Do you not tremble at the fearful State of ſuch a Man? If you do not, you juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may. O take heed leſt by your ſtubborn and obſtinate Perſeverance in your Sins againſt all Means for reclaiming you, you at length bring your ſelf into it.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning that Point. The Point which I have now laſt ſpoken to, was but general, as ariſing from the Conſideration of the Courſe, in general, which God took with <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> for hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and reclaiming him: when gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tler Means did no Good upon him, God made uſe of Afflictions.</p>
            <p>I come to a more particular Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that Affliction which God was pleaſed to lay upon him; <hi>The Lord brought upon them,</hi> upon him and his People, <hi>the Captains of the Hoſt of the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:61506:161"/>King of</hi> Aſſyria, <hi>and they took</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>among the Thorns, and bound him with Fetters, and carried him to</hi> Babylon. And here;</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Whereas 'tis ſaid, that <hi>the Lord brought upon them the Captains of the Hoſt of the King of</hi> Aſſyria,</p>
            <p>We may obſerve, That 'tis of God that one Nation makes War againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; that one Country invades ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſubjects it to all the Miſeries and Calamities of the Sword. This is frequently in the holy Scriptures aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the over-ruling Providence of God, and that not only in way of mere Permiſſion, but ſo as God is made in ſome Senſe the Author and Procurer of Wars and Invaſions, and the Inflicter of all the Miſeries that attend them. Here the Lord is ſaid to have brought upon <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Hoſt of the King of <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi> Thus in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24.2, 3, 4. we read, that <hi>the Lord ſent against</hi> Jehoia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim <hi>Bands of the</hi> Chaldees, <hi>and Bands of the</hi> Syrians, <hi>and Bands of the</hi> Moabites, <hi>and Bands of the Children of</hi> Ammon; <hi>and that he ſent them against</hi> Judah <hi>to deſtroy it, according to the Word that he had ſpoken by his Servants the Prophets.</hi>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:61506:162"/>And by way of further Confirmation that all this was of God, it follows in the next Words, <hi>Surely at the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord came this upon</hi> Judah, <hi>to remove them out of his Sight, for the Sins of</hi> Manaſſeh. And thus is God ſaid to have ſtirred up <hi>Hadad</hi> the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> againſt <hi>Solomon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 11.14.</note> and to have <hi>ſtirred up another Adverſary against him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> Rezon <hi>the Son of</hi> Eliadah. So God, ſpeaking of the Executioners of his Juſtice whom he would make uſe of to puniſh his People,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.26.</note> ſaith, he would <hi>lift up an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to the Nations from far, and that he would hiſs unto them from the Ends of the Earth, that they might come with Speed ſwiftly.</hi> So again, ſpeaking of his calling for other Nations to invade the Land,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 7.18, 19.</note> he ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſhall hiſs for the Flie that is in the uttermoſt part of the River of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and for the Bee that is in the Land of</hi> Aſſyria; <hi>and they ſhall come, and ſhall reſt all of them in the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Valleys.</hi> So deſcribing a cruel and implacable Enemy which he would cauſe to invade them, he ſaith, <hi>Behold, I will ſend Serpents,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 8.17.</note> 
               <hi>Cockatrices among you, which will not be charmed, and they ſhall bite you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 16.16.</note> 
               <hi>Behold, I will ſend for many Fiſhers, and they ſhall fiſh them:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:61506:162"/>and after that I will ſend for many Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and they ſhall hunt them from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mountain, and from every Hill, and out of the Holes of the Rocks. Behold, I will ſend and take all the Families of the North, ſaith the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 25.9.</note> 
               <hi>and</hi> Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar <hi>the King of</hi> Babylon <hi>my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and will bring them againſt this Land, and against the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. O Aſſyrian,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 10.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>the Rod of mine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Staff in their Hand is mine Indignation. I will ſend him against an Hypocritical Nation, and againſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my Wrath will I give him a Charge to take the Spoil, and to take the Prey, and to tread them down like the Mire in the Streets.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 13.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>I have commanded my ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Ones, I have alſo called my mighty Ones for mine Anger. The Voice of a Multitude in the Mountains, as of a great People; a tumultuous Noiſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Nations gathered together: the Lord of Hoſts muſtereth the Host of the Battel.</hi> This is to be underſtood of the <hi>Medes</hi> whom God would imploy for the Deſtruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as is afterwards more plainly expreſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. where God ſaith, <hi>Behold, I will ſtir up the</hi> Medes <hi>againſt them, which ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:61506:163"/>Silver; and as for Gold, they ſhall not delight in it.</hi> Thus we ſee that God is ſaid to ſtir up Adverſaries, to hiſs for Enemies, to ſend and imploy them againſt a ſinful People that is to be puniſhed, to call them the Rod of his Anger, to ſtile them his ſanctified Ones. Such Inſtruments as he hath made choice of, and ſet a-part for the Service of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Executioners of his Wrath, he calls them his Servants, he is ſaid to command them, and to give them a Charge to perform the Work which he ſets them about; he is ſaid to lift up an Enſign for them, and to muſter their Armies. By all which Expreſſions 'tis evident that 'tis not only by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but by his Order and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that one Nation takes up Arms againſt, and invades another. But here however we muſt take heed that we make not God the Author or Abettor of the Sins of Men. He neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth any Malice or Wickedneſs into their Hearts, nor ſtirs them up by any ſinful Motives to act as they do. As his Ends and Deſigns are moſt juſt and holy, ſo are all the Means and Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents which he makes uſe of for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing thoſe Ends. How and in what
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:61506:163"/>manner his moſt wiſe, powerful, holy and righteous Providence influenceth and over-ruleth, directs and orders, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates and governs the very worſt Actions of the very worſt Men, is one of thoſe deep things of God which are rather to be adored in Silence, than raſhly to be diſcourſed of and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Moſt ſure we are that God makes uſe of wicked Men, and ſerves himſelf of them even in thoſe things by which they moſt highly provoke him; and yet as ſure we are that he doth all this moſt righteouſly, he being <hi>juſt in all his Ways, and holy in all his Works.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 145.17.</note> In this therefore let us acquieſce and reſt ſatisfied; and inſtead of attempting to dive into thoſe profound Counſels of God, which while we are here we ſhall never be able fully and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſively to underſtand our ſelves, much leſs to unfold and explain them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; let us ſee what Uſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement may be made of what hath been ſpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is it of God that one Nation makes War with, and invades another? Then let us acknowledg God, and take notice of his Hand in all Diſpenſations of this nature.</p>
            <pb n="310" facs="tcp:61506:164"/>
            <p n="1">1. Are other Nations infeſted with War? Have they been haraſſed, laid deſolate, and even ruined by the Sword, while we in this Land have been at reſt, ſitting quietly under our own Vines and Fig-trees, and drinking the Waters of our own Ciſterns? Let us be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the unſpeakable Goodneſs, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Long-ſufferance of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in this merciful Diſpenſation. Surely it cannot be denied but that our Sins have been as great as the Sins of thoſe our Neighbours abroad, that have moſt ſuffered by the Sword. Yea rather, if the Aggravations of our Sins be well conſidered, it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that our Sins have not only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled, but exceeded theirs. For our Mercies and Deliverances have not been common and ordinary, but ſignal and eminent; and theſe have not a little heightned our Provocations. What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account therefore can be given of God's Forbearance towards us in a time when he hath ſhewed ſo much Severity againſt other Nations, but that <hi>he is gracious to whom he will be gracious,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 33.19.</note> 
               <hi>and ſheweth Mercy to whom he will ſhew Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> as he himſelf hath declared? Let us all be duly affected with this his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:61506:164"/>Patience towards a moſt ſinful People, and give him the Glory of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are we at preſent full of many juſt Fears that it may e're long be our Lot to drink of the ſame Cup that our Neighbours beyond the Sea have drank of? Do our own inteſtine Rents and Diviſions which were never more ſad than at preſent, and the bloody Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of thoſe many Enemies which we have within our own Bowels, threaten us at home? And do our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad lie at the Catch to take the Advantages againſt us which our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions give them, and to make the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Improvement of them? Do theſe things, together with the Thoughts of our crying Sins, afright us, and make us queſtion whether the Dregs of that Cup of trembling which hath been put into the Hands of others, may not be reſerved for us? Amidſt our Fears,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Let us look up to God who thus ſhakes his Rod over the Land, and by ſound Repentance and Reformation, perſonal Reformation, let us make our Peace with him who ruleth over all the Kingdoms of the World, and hath the Hearts of all Men, even of Kings, in his Hand,
<note place="margin">Prov. 21.1.</note> and <hi>turns them as the Rivers of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:61506:165"/>Water, whither-ſoever he will.</hi> This is the beſt way to be ſecured againſt all Adverſaries ſo far as it ſhall be for God's Glory and our Good. <hi>When a Man's Ways pleaſe the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 16.7.</note> 
               <hi>he will make his Enemies to be at Peace with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Having made our own Peace with God, let us be truly humbled for the Sins of the Land, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for thoſe Sins which moſt threaten us with the Invaſion of a foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; ſuch as are, our Imitation of the Vices of other Nations, our Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, or our Approaches to them in any of their Superſtitions; our aping them, and conforming to them in their vain and phantaſtical Garbs and Faſhions. In reſpect of theſe things the Jews doted upon the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and were fondly in love with them; for which Sins God threatned to <hi>give them up into their Hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.</note> as we may ſee. If we can be throughly humbled for our own Sins, and be reformed; and if we can be ſincerely humbled for, and heartily mourn over the Sins of the Land, we ſhall hereby take the moſt effectual Courſe for ſecuring our ſelves againſt whatſoever may be coming on the Nation. We read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:61506:165"/>God commanded a Mark to be ſet upon the Fore-heads of the Men that ſighed and cried for all the Abominations that were done in the midſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Executioners of his Wrath might paſs them by, and ſpare them. And 'tis alſo the beſt Courſe that we can take for obtaining Mercy for the Land, and for averting thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Sins thereof cry aloud to Heaven for. By the Interceſſions of a few, thus humbling themſelves for their own Sins, and mourning for the Sins of others, the Wrath of God is ſometimes turned away from the Places where they live. But however, they are ſure to deliver their own Souls, though they cannot obtain Mercy for others, as we may gather from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice to have been ſpoken concerning the Lord's bringing upon <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and his People the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Hoſt of the King of</hi> Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria. What theſe Captains did, and with what Succeſs they managed their Buſineſs, is expreſs'd in the Words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; <hi>They took</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>in the Thorns, and bound him with Fetters, and carried him to</hi> Babylon. <hi>They took</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:61506:166"/>
               <hi>in the Thorns;</hi> it was, as it ſeems, a Place of Thorns or Thickets, whither <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> in the Dread and Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit under which he was, had fled to hide and ſhelter himſelf from the Enemy. So we read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.6. that the Iſraelites being greatly diſtreſſed by the Philiſtines that oppreſſed them, <hi>did hide themſelves in Caves, and in Thiekets, and in Rocks, and in high Places, and in Pits.</hi> Now whereas <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> though a King, was brought into that Diſtreſs, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to hide himſelf in the Thorns from his Enemies, we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>That great Men and Perſons of high Places, and great Dignity, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be reduced to great Extremities, and be put to make uſe of hard Shifts to preſerve themſelves. <hi>Siſera</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General and Commander in chief of the Army of <hi>Jabin</hi> King of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 4.15, 16, 17.</note> was forced to light off his Chariot, and on his Feet to betake himſelf to the Houſe of <hi>Heber</hi> the <hi>Kenite,</hi> to ſave his Life, which yet he could not do, but loſt it there by the Hand of a Woman. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, were conſtrained to dig through a Wall, to make way for their Flight
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:61506:166"/>in the Night,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 12. Jer. 39.</note> that they might not fall into the Hands of the <hi>Chaldees;</hi> and yet was <hi>Zedekiah</hi> taken by them, and being bound with Fetters, ſaw his Sons ſlain before his Eyes; and then after that lamentable Spectacle, the laſt that ever he ſaw, had his Eyes put out. All Ages, and even our own times, have been full of the like Inſtances of the Mutability and Uncertainty of all earthly things. The Conſideration hereof may be uſeful to us ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence may ſuch as are in Places of Eminency above others, or enjoy more of the things of this World than others do, learn not to truſt in their Riches, Honour, Power, Greatneſs, or whatever elſe it is in which they excel others. All theſe things are fading and tranſitory, they are inconſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, they have their Turns and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions; he that is full to Day, may be empty to Morrow; he that is now uppermoſt, may e're long be nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. How high ſoever any Man be, God can bring him low enough before he dies:
<note place="margin">Obad. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Although thou exalt thy ſelf as the Eagle; and though thou ſet thy Neſt among the Stars, yet thence will I bring thee down, ſaid the Lord to</hi> Edom. Of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:61506:167"/>this ſad Change <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complains, and laments over it;
<note place="margin">Lam. 4.5.</note> 
               <hi>They that did feed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately, are deſolate in the Streets: they that were brought up in Scarlet, imbrace Dunghills.</hi> A remarkable Inſtance we have of the Inſtability and Uncertainty of theſe temporal things, in <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> a great and famous Commander of the Forces of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperor. This renowned and victorious General, after that he had ſubdued the <hi>Perſians,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Goths,</hi> and vanquiſhed the <hi>Vandalls;</hi> and by theſe his Victories raiſed himſelf ſo high as that he became the Object both of the Fear and Envy of Equals and Inferiours, was at length reduced to that Want and Miſery, that he was conſtrained to beg by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-ſide, crying out to Travellers that paſſed by, <hi>Date Obolum Beliſario,</hi> give a Half-penny to <hi>Beliſarius.</hi> Let no Man therefore make Account that he ſtands ſo faſt and firm, but that his Feet may ſlip, and he may take a Fall; and the higher he is, the more dangerous will his Fall be. Neither is there any thing that threatens a Man more with a Fall than carnal Security, and a vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Firmneſs and Stability of his preſent Station, and the Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:61506:167"/>of that proſperous Condition in which he is. When <hi>David</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 30.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>In his Proſperity I ſhall never be moved; Lord, by thy Favour thou haſt made my Mountain to ſtand ſtrong: God did</hi> but <hi>hide his Face, and he was troubled.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.3.</note> 
               <hi>When Men ſhall ſay, Peace and Safety; then ſudden Deſtruction cometh upon them, as Travail upon a Woman with Child; and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 18.7, 8.</note> When Myſtical <hi>Babylon</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſit</hi> as <hi>a Queen, and am no Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſhall ſee no Sorrow: Then ſhall her Plagues come in one Day, Death, and Mourning, and Famine; and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with Fire: for ſtrong is the Lord God who judgeth her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence you may alſo learn, not to inſult over thoſe who having formerly been in a better Condition, are now brought low; their preſent Condition may be your own; you have no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Security againſt being emptied from Veſſel to Veſſel, as they have been, or againſt being ſubjected to the ſame Changes which they have undergone. The Conſideration hereof ſhould beget in you Moderation towards Sufferers, and ſuch a compaſſionate Senſe of their Adverſities, as becomes them who remember that they themſelves
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:61506:168"/>are ſtill in the Body,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.3.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seeing the Higheſt may be brought low, and none are exempted from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obnoxious to Changes and Adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it concerns all to prepare for Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and to be always in a readineſs to entertain them. And thoſe whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition hath elevated them above the common Sort, and ſet them on high, have ſo much the greater reaſon to be prepared for Changes, becauſe they are moſt in danger of them, they being more expoſed to Concuſſions and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; as the tall Oaks and lofty Cedars are more expoſed to the Violence of Storms and Tempeſts, than the lower Shrubs are. Again, it concerns theſe above others to labour to be prepared for Changes, becauſe they are ſo apt to think themſelves to be above the reach of them: For this fond Conceit is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with two great Miſchiefs.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Their fancying themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach of Changes, expoſeth them to Changes ſo much the ſooner; for the evil Day is ſo much the nearer unto Men, by how much they put it farther off from themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="319" facs="tcp:61506:168"/>
            <p n="2">(2.) When Changes come upon Men that had no expectation of them, and that made ſure account they were in no danger, they are ſurprized with them, and the Surprizal makes them the more grievous to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Though none, no not the higheſt, be exempted from being ſubject to Changes, yet may not ſomething be done towards the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of Changes, and ſecuring our ſelves againſt them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Though nothing that can be done, can abſolutely ſecure the higheſt againſt Changes, yet there are ſome things that do very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce towards Mens Safety and Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and they are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Humility. To have a low and humble Heart in a high Condition, is both a great Ornament, and a great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to a Man. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Prov. 29.23.</note> 
               <hi>A Man's Pride ſhall bring him low; but Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ſhall uphold the humble in Spirit.</hi> And St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith out of <hi>Solomon</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, though with ſome little Alteration,
<note place="margin">Jam. 4.6. Prov. 16.18.</note> 
               <hi>God reſiſteth the Proud, but giveth Grace unto the Humble. Pride goeth before De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and an haughty Spirit before a Fall.</hi> And again, <hi>Before Deſtruction
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:61506:169"/>the Heart of Man is haughty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 18.12.</note> 
               <hi>and before Honour is Humility.</hi> I ſhall add but one Place more, which ſhall be <hi>Job</hi> 40.10, 11, 12. where God himſelf ſpeaking to <hi>Job,</hi> and ſetting before him for his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, God's incomparable Greatneſs and tranſcendent Excellencies, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the Effects of his Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, ſaith, <hi>Deck thy ſelf now with Majeſty and Excellency, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray thy ſelf with Glory and Beauty; cast abroad the Rage of thy Wrath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold every one that is proud, and abaſe him: Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low.</hi> In which Words God tells <hi>Job</hi> what he is wont to do, and bids him do the like if he be able; thereby to convince him of the infinite Diſtance between God and him. But that which is to my preſent Purpoſe, is, that God here makes his caſting abroad the Rage of his Wrath, and his beholding every one that is proud that he may abaſe him, and his looking upon every one that is proud that he may bring him low, an Inſtance of the great Works of God's moſt wiſe, powerful and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Providence. So then this is the conſtant Courſe of his Providence to behold and abaſe whoever is proud;
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:61506:169"/>and he is ſaid <hi>to cast abroad the Rage of his Fury</hi> when he doth it, to note the high Indignation that he hath againſt that Sin,
<note place="margin">Prov. 6.16, 17.</note> which therefore is ſaid to be <hi>an Abomination to him. Theſe ſix things doth the Lord hate; yea ſeven are an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to him: A proud Look, a lying Tongue, and Hands that ſhed innocent Blood,</hi> &amp;c. So then a proud Look is in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Catalogue the firſt of thoſe Sins that are an Abomination to the Lord. By theſe Scriptures it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the Sin of Pride is moſt hateful and abominable in the ſight of God; that he caſts his Eyes about, and beholds every one that is proud, that he may abaſe him and bring him low; that he reſiſteth the Proud, and ſets himſelf againſt him, but ſupports and upholds the humble in Spirit. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I ſay, if ſuch as are high would prevent a Fall, they muſt be humble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt acknowledg the free Bounty and Goodneſs of God in what they are or have above others, and give him the Glory of it. They muſt not think that they ſhine in a higher Orb, and have more of the World than others have, becauſe they are better, and have deſerved more at the Hands of God
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:61506:170"/>than others, but reckon that they owe all to the pure and undeſerved Mercy of God, which alone hath diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from him that is clothed with Rags, and begs his Bread from Door to Door.

But when you take no notice of God in what you enjoy, when you give him not your humble and thankful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments thereof, and aſcribe all to his his free Mercy, then are you in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to be deprived of whatever you have received at his Hands. Thus when God's People <hi>did not know,</hi> that is, did

If ſuch as are in Place of Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy above their Brethren, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with a larger Portion of the good things of this World than others have, would prevent a Fall, and obtain at the Hands of God the continuance of theſe his Mercies to them, they muſt make a good uſe of what they excel others in, and of what they are intruſted with above their Brethren. Hath God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them in a higher Sphere above their Brethren? Hath he made them the Head, and not the Tail? Let them uſe their Power, not to cruſh and oppreſs their Inferiours, but to ſtrengthen, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and uphold them.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:61506:171"/>and Vanity, they take the ready Courſe to be deſpoiled and ſtripp'd of all thoſe Bleſſings which they ſo horribly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God by, making them the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Sin, and turning them into Fewel for their Luſts.</p>
            <p>And ſo I have done with that Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That when God will puniſh Men for their Sins, no Means which they can make uſe of, ſhall ſecure them from his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a Truth that no Man can que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion who believes and acknowledgeth the Infinite Power and Wiſdom of God, and the Abſolute Dominion and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty that he hath over all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He being Infinite in Power, can do whatſoever he pleaſeth. <hi>If he will

               <hi>My Counſel ſhall ſtand,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I will do all my Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He being Infinite in Wiſdom as well as in Power, knows how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive and order, to diſpoſe of and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, over-rule and govern all the Means conducing to their Puniſhment, ſo as all the Wiſdom of Men and Angels ſhall not be able to deviſe or contrive any thing that may counterwork his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or hinder the Accompliſhment of his Deſigns.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He moreover having an Abſolute Dominion and Soveraignty over all Creatures, and they being all at his Command, he can either imploy them as he pleaſeth for puniſhing ſuch as he will puniſh, or forbid them to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them, and reſtrain them from doing any thing whereby they may be reſcued from Puniſhment. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) When God will puniſh Men, when he will have them ſuffer for their Sins, he will ſometimes diſenable them to make uſe of any Means whereby they may help themſelves. When they ſhould run away from Danger, they have no Power to do it, but ſtand ſtill as Men confounded and aſtoniſhed, till
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:61506:172"/>their Fears overtake them, and come upon them: when they ſhould act to ſecure themſelves againſt the Evils which threaten them, they cannot <hi>find their Hands,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 76.5.</note> When they ſhould be caſting about and contriving what may be for their Safety and Security, they are at their Wits End, and cannot make uſe of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to relieve themſelves in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes: <hi>Their Wiſdom faileth them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 10.3.</note> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Sometimes again when they contrive and conſult for their Safety, God blaſteth their Counſels, and turns them into Fooliſhneſs; when they make uſe of Means, God makes the very Means which they made uſe of for their Preſervation, an occaſion of their Ruine: As <hi>Siſera</hi> betaking himſelf to the Houſe of <hi>Heber</hi> the <hi>Kenite,</hi> to ſave his Life,
<note place="margin">Judg. 4.15, 16, 17.</note> loſt it, and met with that Deſtruction there, which by running thither he ſought to avoid; while he flies from the Sword, he meets with a Nail that pierced through his Temples. If they eſcape one Judgment, they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by another. Thus <hi>Sennacherib</hi> having eſcaped the Peril of the Sword abroad,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 32.21.</note> is ſlain at home in the Houſe of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:61506:173"/>
               <hi>Niſroch</hi> his God, by thoſe that came out of his own Bowels. Thus God threatning wicked Men, ſaith, it ſhall be with them,
<note place="margin">Amos 5.19</note> 
               <hi>as if a Man did flee from a Lion, and a Bear met him; or went into the Houſe, and laid his Hand on the Wall, and a Serpent bit him.</hi> Much to the ſame Effect God threatning <hi>Moah,</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Jer. 48.43, 44.</note> 
               <hi>Fear, and the Pit, and the Snare ſhall be unto thee. He that fleeth from the Fear, ſhall fall into the Pit; and he that getteth out of the Pit, ſhall be taken in the Snare.</hi> When once a Man hath by his Sins made himſelf obnoxious to the Juſtice of God, whither can he flee from his revenging Hand? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever he goes, he is ſure to meet with an incenſed God: Whitherſoever he withdraws himſelf, he cannot run away from him who is omnipreſent. <hi>Can any hide himſelf in ſecret Places, ſaith the Lord? Do not I fill Heaven and Earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Jer. 23.24. <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? and whither ſhall I flee from thy Preſence?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 139.5, 8, 9, 10.</note> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt: <hi>If I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there: if I make my Bed in Hell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou art there: If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parts of the Sea; even there ſhall
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:61506:173"/>thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand ſhall hold me.</hi> If a Man be your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſeeks to do you a Miſchief, you may poſſibly get you away from him, and retire you to ſome Place or other, where he ſhall not be able to find you, or where he may not reach you. Though Kings have long Arms, as we ſay, and can by themſelves and by their Miniſters and Inſtruments reach a great way, yet they cannot reach ſo far, but that ſometimes ſuch as have offended them make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhift to get them out of their reach. But if a Man ſhall have offended God, if he ſhall by his Provocations have made God his Enemy, whither can he betake himſelf where he may be without the reach of his Juſtice? Surely he muſt go out of the World that would go away from God: And if he ſhould ſo do, yet would he meet with God in the other World, and even there would he fall under his Sin-revenging Juſtice. Hence it is that God often ſpeaks of himſelf, as of one that hath ſuch a powerful Arm, and ſuch irreſiſtible Might, that no created Power can reſcue any out of his Hand, when he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to make them Inſtances of his
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:61506:174"/>Juſtice, and of his fierce Indignation againſt Sin, by inflicting exemplary Puniſhments on them. Having threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſeverely threatned to reckon with the wicked, the obſtinate and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinner, that in the height of his carnal Security, thinks God to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch an one as himſelf; he at length concludes, <hi>Conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you,</hi> Pſal. 50.22. <hi>Ye are my Witneſſes, ſaith the Lord, that I am God. Yea, before the Day was, I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my Hand,</hi> Iſa. 43.12, 13. <hi>See now, that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any that can deliver out of my Hand. For I lift up my Hand to Heaven, and ſay, I live for ever. If I whet my Sword, and my Hand take hold on Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will render Vengeance to mine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and reward them that hate me. I will make mine Arrows drunk with Blood, and my Sword ſhall devour Fleſh,</hi> Deut. 32.39, 40, 41, 42. Thus I have ſhewed that when God will puniſh Men for their Sins, no Means they can make uſe of, ſhall ſecure them againſt his Judgments. Neither their high Quality in the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:61506:174"/>World, nor the Eminency of their Rank and Condition, nor their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, nor their Power, nor their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor their Riches, nor their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, nor their Friends, nor any thing elſe that can be named, ſhall do them any Good, or ſtand them in any ſtead, to interpoſe between them and the Wrath of God, and skreen off his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from them. I come now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this Point briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Let no Man therefore, let no impenitent Sinner be incouraged to go on in his evil Ways by the vain Hopes of going unpuniſhed, and of eſcaping the Judgments of God. A Man that ſhall thus flatter himſelf, that makes account he ſhall be able to find Means to eſcape the Judgments of God who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be puniſhed; ſuch an one above all others ſhall be ſure to be puniſhed moſt ſeverely. Conſider how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully God hath threatned ſuch hardned, ſecure, and fearleſs Sinners: <hi>He that bleſſeth himſelf in his Heart, ſaying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 29.19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>I ſhall have Peace, though I walk in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination of my Heart, to add Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs to Thirſt: The Lord will not ſpare him, but the Anger of the Lord,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:61506:175"/>and his Jealouſy ſhall ſmoke against that Man; and all the Curſes that are written in the Law ſhall lie upon him: and the Lord ſhall blot out his Name from under Heaven.</hi> Such ſecure Sinners were thoſe whom God threatned: <hi>It ſhall come to paſs that I will ſearch</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>with Candles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zeph. 1.12</note> 
               <hi>and will puniſh them that are ſettled on their Lees, and that ſay is their Hearts, The Lord will not do Good, neither will he do Evil.</hi> As if they had ſaid, The Lord is in Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not what is done by us here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; he will neither reward us if we do well, nor puniſh us if we do ill. Such obdurate and ſecure Sinners as theſe, God would find out whereſoever they ſhould be; he would ſearch <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> with Candles for them, that he might puniſh them. Not one of them that upon the narroweſt Search could be found out, ſhould eſcape his righteous Judgments. So again, God threatned that ſuch as did <hi>put far away the evil Day,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 6.3, 4, 5, 7.</note> did make account that the Day of Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when God would reckon with them for their Sins, would never come, or that it would be long enough before it would come; and that thereupon <hi>cauſed the Seat of Violence to come near;</hi>
               <pb n="333" facs="tcp:61506:175"/>gave themſelves to Rapine, Oppreſſion and Injuſtice; and moreover glutted themſelves with ſinful Pleaſures and Delights, addicting themſelves to all manner of Riot and Exceſs; I ſay, God threatned theſe ſecure Sinners, that they <hi>ſhould go captive with the firſt that ſhould go captive.</hi> So then, none are more ſure to be puniſhed, and to be puniſhed ſeverely and ſpeedily, than they who leaſt fear it, and who are moſt confident of their Safety and Security.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Let all impenitent Sinners therefore be perſwaded and exhorted to labour to make their Peace with God, and to do it ſpeedily, leſt the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God overtake them, and come upon them, before they have done it. Let them not be ſlack herein, and put it off from Day to Day, as if there were no Danger in delaying it. They may, perhaps, think there is very little in thoſe. Threatnings and Denunciations of Judgments which they often hear; and that ſuch an evil Day as they have been frighted with, ſhall never come; or if it do come, that they ſhall be able to make a ſhift to ſecure themſelves well enough: They have ſuch and ſuch
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:61506:176"/>Advantages above other Men; and therefore whoever ſuffer, they hope they may find Means to be exempted from ſuffering. But let none deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; theſe are but idle Dreams and vain Fancies. When God comes to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit Mens Sins upon them, he comes ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly. All the Means in the World for keeping off God's Judgments, all their Advantages for ſecuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will ſignify nothing. Whatever they may ſeem to have to ſafe-guard and protect themſelves againſt the Wrath of God, their Sins have made them naked,
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.25.</note> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> They lie as open, and as much expoſed to the Judgments of God, as if they were perfectly ſtripp'd of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might promiſe them any Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Security in an evil Day. 'Tis true, Mens Riches, and Power, and Policy, and Intereſts, may help them to withſtand many a Shock, and to weather out many a Storm: But when the Day comes which God hath ſet, and appointed for reckoning with them, then all theſe things in which they truſt, ſhall afford them no Relief at all. It may be inſtead of relieving and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting them, they may contribute to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:61506:176"/>their Ruine. So we know God often curſeth Mens Policies,
<note place="margin">Job 5.13.</note> and cauſeth the Wiſe to be taken <hi>in their own Craftineſs,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks: And their Riches do them no other Service than only to make them a more deſirable Prey to the Enemy. When the time comes that they are to be puniſhed, in vain ſhall they hope to eſcape, whatever they have to protect and defend themſelves withal, and to ward off thoſe Evils that are coming upon them. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> fore-telling, and prophetically deſcribing the Overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Army, and all his hired Forces, by the Army of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and the ſore Diſtreſs of <hi>Egypt</hi> attending that Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, ſaith,
<note place="margin">Jer. 46.21.</note> 
               <hi>Her hired Men in the midſt of her, are like fatted Bullocks; for they are turned back, and are fled away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: they did not ſtand, becauſe the Day of their Calamity was come upon them, and the time of their Viſitation.</hi> When the time of Mens Calamity, and the Day of Mens Viſitation is come, nothing ſhall help them or deliver them out of the Hands of God. This Inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy and Unavailableneſs of all Means for affording of Relief, God emphatically ſets forth, when ſpeaking
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:61506:177"/>to <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> he ſaith, <hi>Go up to</hi> Gilead, <hi>and take Balm, O Virgin, the Daughter of</hi> Egypt; <hi>in vain ſhalt thou uſe many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, for thou ſhalt not be healed.</hi> I ſay therefore, make your Peace with God, and do it ſpeedily before it be too late.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 55.6.</note> 
               <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near;</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet exhorts. Seek him for the Pardon of your Sins; ſeek him for the avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Judgments, which by your Sins you have deſerved, and which are hanging over your Heads. To the ſame Effect is that Exhortation of the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zeph. 2.1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Gather your ſelves together; yea, gather together, O Nation not deſired: before the Decree bring forth, before the Day paſs as the Chaff; before the fierce Anger of the Lord come upon you, before the Day of the Lord's Anger come upon you.

<note place="margin">Heb. 10.31</note> that <hi>'tis a fearful thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of the living God,</hi> as the

               <hi>When he was in Affliction.</hi> A ſore and heavy Affliction it was for a King to fall into the Hands of his Enemies that thirſted after his Blood, to be bound with Fetters, to be carried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into a ſtrange Land, to be there a Priſoner ſtanding in fear of his Life eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day and every hour: This was ſuch an Affliction as could not but deeply affect him, and go near his Heart. Now queſtionleſs he bitterly recounts and calls to mind what he enjoyed at home in his own Land, where he ſat upon the Throne and ſwayed the Scepter, and how lamentable a Change of his Condition he had lived to ſee. At length he looks beyond his Enemies, and takes notice of the Hand of God in all that had come upon him; and this brings to his Mind thoſe his grievous Sins and horrid Crimes, by which in the time of his Proſperity he had provoked God to give him up into the Hands of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to bring upon him all that Miſery under which he now ſmarted. Now he calls to mind how often God had by his Servants the Prophets called him to Repentance; how often he had been forewarned of all the Miſery that he would bring upon himſelf, if he did
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:61506:178"/>not by timely Repentance prevent it. Now he ſadly remembers how wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly he had ſtopped his Ears, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Heart againſt good Counſels and Admonitions: And this at length ſets him a praying, and humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before God, which till this time he could never be perſwaded to do. When God was pleaſed to correct and chaſten him in this ſevere and extraordinary manner, then, and not till then, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of returning unto God, from whom he had revolted. <hi>When he was in Affliction, he beſought the Lord his God.</hi>

               <hi>That Afflictions will work upon Men, and prevail with them to return to God from whom they have gone aſtray, when all other Means are ineffectual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the right underſtanding of this Point, we muſt know that Afflictions of themſelves cannot effect this gracious Change in any Man. 'Tis not ſo much from any natural Property or inherent Virtue in Afflictions that they thus work, as it is from God who ſanctifieth Afflictions, and makes them Means of ſpiritual Good to as many as he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:61506:179"/>to work upon by them. If God be not pleaſed to ſanctify Afflictions, and to accompany them with the effectual Operation of his Spirit upon the Hearts of Men, they are never the better for them, it may be they are much the worſe; inſtead of being reduced from the Error of their Ways, and of being reclaimed and brought home to God, they are driven farther away from him. So we read concerning <hi>Ahaz,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 28.22.</note> that <hi>in the time of his Diſtreſs he treſpaſſed yet more againſt the Lord.</hi> Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> when in his Diſtreſs he ſhould have had recourſe unto God for Relief,
<note place="margin">1 Sam 28.7, 8.</note> betook himſelf to the Devil, and conſulted with the Witch of <hi>Endor.</hi> The like did <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> who in his Sickneſs,
<note place="margin">2 King. 1.2</note> as if there had been no God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſent unto <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> to enquire whether he ſhould recover. Thus though the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God that had been inflicted on the Votaries and Adherents of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
<note place="margin">Rev. 16.10, 11.</note> were ſo terrible, that they gnawed their Tongues for Pain, yet they blaſphemed the God of Heaven becauſe of their Pains and their Sores, and repented not of their Deeds. And this is that which is confirmed by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day's Experience: We ſee many
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:61506:179"/>wicked Men that are emptied from Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to Veſſel, and haraſſed with all ſorts of Afflictions; and yet they are as bad as ever they were; yea perhaps the more they are afflicted, the more are their Hearts eſtranged from God, and the more are they hardned in their Sins. How little Good is done upon wicked Men by Afflictions unleſs they be ſanctified to them, <hi>Solomon</hi> infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth us, ſaying,
<note place="margin">Prov. 27.22.</note> 
               <hi>Though thou ſhouldſt bray a Fool in a Mortar among Wheat with a Peſtle, yet will not his Fooliſhneſs depart from him. Solomon</hi>'s Fool is a wicked Man, whoſe Fooliſhneſs is his Wickedneſs: This his Wickedneſs will not depart from him, though you bray him with a Peſtle in a Mortar; though you beat him, and bruiſe him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven pound him to pieces, yet will he ſtill be the ſame, every way as bad and as wicked as he was when you firſt took him in hand. Afflictions may batter him, bruiſe him, and break him; but without God's ſanctifying Grace concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and cooperating with them, they will never change a Man's Nature, or purge away his Corruption.</p>
            <p>And here by the way, we may learn two things from hence.</p>
            <pb n="342" facs="tcp:61506:180"/>
            <p n="1">1. In all our Afflictions to look up to God, and beg of him that he would vouchſafe to ſanctify them to us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot expect to receive any Good by them. They may do us Hurr, but they can do us no Good; they may make us worſe, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make us better without his Bleſſing. 'Tis eaſy to obſerve what ſad Work Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, through the Corruption of Man's Nature, make, when they light upon wicked Men, and are not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to them; how they repine, and fret, and murmur; how in the height of their Impatience they toſs themſelves like <hi>a wild Bull in a Net,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet expreſſeth it; how they oft-times blaſpheme God, and fall foul upon Men who have been in God's Hand the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their Sufferings. Whoſo conſiders this, cannot but think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf highly concerned to be an earneſt Suitor unto God, that his Afflictions may be ſo ſanctified to him, as that he may be enabled to make a holy Uſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them, and not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by them into thoſe ſinful Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, into which the Corruption of our Nature would hurry us.</p>
            <pb n="343" facs="tcp:61506:180"/>
            <p n="2">2. We may alſo learn humbly and thankfully to acknowledg the Goodneſs of God to us; if we have received any Benefit by our Afflictions, to bleſs God for it, and to give him the Glory of it. Have our Afflictions brought us to the ſight of our Sins? Have they humbled us? Have they reduced us from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of our Ways, and led us home to God? Let us not think theſe things to be the natural Iſſues and Fruits of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. No ſuch matter: 'tis God, and he alone that puts Efficacy into Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for the production of theſe great and excellent things. Wherefore let us aſcribe them not to the Means, but to God, and accordingly bleſs him for them.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Point to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on. Afflictions will work upon Men, and prevail with them to return to God from whom they have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, when all other Means are ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. Afflictions, if God be pleaſed to ſanctify them, will do Men good when no other Means will. This Truth may be confirmed both from Scripture and Experience.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) From Scripture it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. <hi>David,</hi> when he was out of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:61506:181"/>the way, wanted not other Means to reduce him, and to ſet him right again; but yet he acknowledgeth that Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were the Means by which he was recalled from his Wandrings:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.67.</note> 
               <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but now I have kept thy Word.</hi> And again, <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 71.</note> 
               <hi>that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> But next to the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Efficacy of Afflictions this way in <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> there is none other ſo full and pertinent, as that of the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Son.
<note place="margin">Luke 15.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> This wild young Man could not be reſtrained, and kept in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by his Father's Inſtructions and Counſels. His Father's Diſcipline was too ſevere for him; his Father's Houſe was little better than a Priſon to him, a ſtrait Confinement not to be endured, and ſuch an Abridgment of his Liberty as was intolerable: Abroad he muſt, and take his Portion along with him alſo. Having withdrawn himſelf from under his Father's Government, and being at liberty, he prodigally and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly ſpends all that he had, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himſelf to extreme Want and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. At length when he was ready to periſh, and knew not what to do, he conſiders how much better it was with
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:61506:181"/>him while he was at home with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and takes up Reſolutions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to him, and of humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before him. Here we ſee Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Miſery works upon this Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and brings him home to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe, when nothing elſe would reclaim him. And all this, what is it elſe but a lively Emblem of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sinner that is gone aſtray from God, and is reduced by Affliction, when nothing elſe will reclaim him?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This Truth may alſo be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from Experience. We may obſerve, and 'tis no difficult matter to obſerve it, that when Men could not be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken off from their vicious Courſes by any other Means, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have done it. Sometimes the Senſe of God's Wrath, and Terrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; ſometimes a ſevere Fit of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that hath brought them near the Grave, or ſome other ſharp Affliction, hath imbittered that Sin to them, and taken off their Hearts from it, which before they could never be perſwaded to part with. And there is no Man that hath any good Acquaintance with himſelf, and with his own Heart, and hath made any obſervation of God's
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:61506:182"/>Dealings with his Soul, but muſt have taken notice that Afflictions have been of that uſe to him, and have done him that Good in making a Separation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his Sins, which nothing elſe could ever do, neither the Word, nor all the Threatnings againſt Sin therein contained, nor the good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Admonitions of Friends, nor the Examples of the Judgments of God inflicted on others for the ſame Sins. When none of all theſe things will make a Man willing to leave his Sins, a Man's own proper Smart and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Afflictions will do it.</p>
            <p>Now if you ask, how God is pleaſed to make Afflictions the Means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming Sinners, and of bringing them home to himſelf when other Means will not do it?</p>
            <p>I anſwer; Afflictions, when God is pleaſed to ſanctify them, do many ways contribute towards the reclaiming of Sinners.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They make Men ſerious; they call in Mens Minds from the things of the World, from the Honours, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, the Pleaſures, the Divertiſements and Vanities thereof, and make them reflect and conſider how 'tis with them
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:61506:182"/>as to their ſpiritual Eſtate, and in what Condition their Souls are, and how Matters ſtand between God and them. Theſe things are little minded while Men are in Proſperity, and they have no Changes; Men have other things to entertain themſelves with, and to take up their Time and their Thoughts; they have things which they are better pleaſed with, and which they take more Content in. But in time of Affliction they retire into themſelves, and are more converſant at home. The time of Adverſity is a time of thinking, and of Conſideration;
<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>In the Day of Adverſity conſider,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> Conſideration is the proper Duty of that Time, and then a Man is fitteſt for it. Now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and ſerious Reflection on our ſelves, are the firſt Step towards our returning to God, and into the way of Obedience, when we have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray. <hi>David</hi> thought on his Ways,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.59.</note> and then turned his Feet unto God's Teſtimonies. And 'tis ſaid of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal when he was in Diſtreſs, that he came to himſelf, and ſaid,
<note place="margin">Luke 15.17.</note> 
               <hi>How many hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Servants of my Father's have Bread enough and to ſpare, and I periſh for Hunger?</hi> He came to himſelf; before he
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:61506:183"/>was beſide himſelf, he was abroad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: while his Portion and his Money laſted, he had other things to mind; but when all was ſpent, and when by his profuſe, prodigal and luxurious Courſes he had brought himſelf to thoſe Extremities that he was ready to be famiſhed, then he began to reflect upon himſelf, and to conſider how fooliſhly he had done in forſaking his Father's Houſe; what Miſery he had thereby brought himſelf into; and how much happier he might have been if he had ſtill kept at home with his Father, and never thought of rambling away from him. Theſe and the like ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections and Conſiderations at length produce the Reſolutions which he takes up, ſaying with himſelf, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and before thee, and am no more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called thy Son; make me as one of thy hired Servants.</hi> And ſo much concerning the firſt thing that Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth towards the reclaiming of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; it makes Men ſerious, it calls in their Minds from the World and the things thereof, and makes them reflect upon themſelves and conſider.</p>
            <pb n="349" facs="tcp:61506:183"/>
            <p n="2">2. Afflictions bring Men to the Sight of their Sins, which is a further Step towards their reclaiming. The Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which God lays upon a Man is oft-times ſuch as to its Kind, Nature and Circumſtances, that it evidently points at a Man's Sin, and plainly ſhews the Sinner what the Sin is which God corrects him for. To make Men ſee and diſcern their Sins, and the better to convince them of their Sins, God often as it were writes the Sin upon the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and that in ſuch fair and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Characters as that all may read it, eſpecially the Sinner himſelf, who is beſt acquainted with his own Sin, and ſo can beſt diſcern how exactly God ſutes the Puniſhment thereunto. A moſt famous and remarkable Inſtance hereof we have in <hi>Adonibezek;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 1.6, 7.</note> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cut off the Thumbs and great Toes of threeſcore and ten Kings, had at length his own Thumbs and great Toes cut off, which made him acknowledg the righteous Judgment of God herein, ſaying, <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me.</hi> But though Afflictions be not ſuch as evidently point at the Sin, and preſently make Men ſee it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it, whether they will or no;
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:61506:184"/>yet do they conduce to the bringing of us to the Sight of our Sins divers ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Afflictions make Men ſenſible of God's Diſpleaſure: When they are afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they apprehend God to be angry with them, though perhaps they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee what it is by which they have provoked him: They ſay within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Surely God is much diſpleaſed with us, or elſe ſuch or ſuch an Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction had never befallen us.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. This makes them ſearch and inquire after the Cauſe of their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Sins by which God hath been ſo much provoked to Diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. This is a Work that Men take little Content in; 'tis a Work which they are moſt averſe from. Men care not how little and how ſeldom they look into themſelves; they had much rather be abroad than at home. But however Afflictions put them upon this unacceptable Work. Search after their Sins they will, rather than ſtill ſmart under the Hand of God that afflicts them.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Afflictions make Men willing to find out their Sins, and they make them ſearch after their Sins as thoſe that have a Mind to find them. Men feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:61506:184"/>the Smart of the Rod, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring to be freed from it, and to be at Eaſe, will ſearch after their Sins narrowly and diligently, they will <hi>ſearch after them with all their Hearts,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks in another Caſe; they will ſearch after them with an earneſt Deſire to find them, and never be at reſt till they do find them, becauſe they know till then they may not hope to be freed from their Afflictions.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Afflictions do alſo open Mens Eyes to ſee that which before they could not or would not ſee. Men are not willing to ſee their Sins; they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly overlook them, or cloſe their Eyes that they may not ſee them: But Afflictions make them ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg thoſe their Errors and Miſcarriages which they would never be convinced of or acknowledg till the Hand of God was upon them. The Child that is corrected, will confeſs and acknowledg his Faults under the Rod, which he would never own or acknowledg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.4.</note> When <hi>David</hi> commanded the People to be numbred, he ſaw not, or would not ſee the Evil of that Action, though <hi>Joab</hi> and the Captains of the Hoſt ſaw it, and utterly diſliked the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:61506:185"/>thing: And as for <hi>Joab,</hi> though he was none of the beſt Men otherwiſe, yet 'tis ſaid of him,
<note place="margin">1 Chron. 21.6.</note> that <hi>the Word of the King was abominable to him.</hi> But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Joab</hi> and the Captains of the Hoſt thought of this Action, <hi>David</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and would have it done, and his Word prevailed againſt <hi>Joab,</hi> and againſt the Captains of the Hoſt, as we read in the Place before-mentioned. Thus far <hi>David</hi> would not be convinced of the Sinfulneſs of his commanding the People to be numbred: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when his Heart had ſmitten him, and eſpecially after that ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his People had been ſwept away by the Peſtilence,
<note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> then he ſaw his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, and cried out, <hi>I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 17.</note> 
               <hi>but theſe Sheep, what have they done? Let thy Hand be againſt me, and againſt my Father's Houſe.</hi> Thus we have ſeen how Afflictions are Means of bringing Men to the Sight of their Sins, and how many ways they conduce thereunto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By Afflictions Men come to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Evil, the hainous Nature and Danger of Sin. Before the Sinner is afflicted, he makes light of Sin, he thinks there is no great Evil or
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:61506:185"/>Danger in thoſe Sins which he indulgeth himſelf in. But when God ſeverely corrects him for thoſe things which he looked upon as ſmall Matters, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pardonable Offences, ſuch venial Sins as he thinks, no Man need queſtion but that they are pardoned in Courſe, and remitted as often and as eaſily as committed; I ſay, when God ſeverely corrects him for thoſe things, then he begins to have other Thoughts of them; then he underſtands that there is much more Evil and Malignity in them than he was aware of; then he begins to be ſenſible of the Danger of allowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in them. Thus by Afflictions God rectifies his Judgment, and corrects his Errors and Miſtakes about the Nature and Danger of Sin.</p>
            <p>The unclean Perſon as long as he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes unpuniſhed, is apt to think he may ſafely enough gratify his Luſt by addicting himſelf to that abominable Sin: But when he feels that his Bones are full of the Sins of his Youth, when he hath brought upon himſelf thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and Diſeaſes, thoſe exquiſite and tormenting Pains which are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Attendants and proper Fruits of that Sin; then he begins to underſtand
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:61506:186"/>that there is much more Evil and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in that Sin than he was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of.</p>
            <p>So the Drunkard is apt to think there is little Evil or Danger in that Exceſs which he often indulgeth himſelf in; but when he finds that he hath thereby ruined himſelf and his diſtreſſed Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he hath brought both himſelf, and ſuch as depend on him, to a Morſel of Bread; and moreover, that he hath overthrown the State of his Body, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired his Health, waſted his Strength, treaſured up in his declining and half-rotten Carcaſe, Matter for all manner of Diſeaſes, almoſt extinguiſhed natural Heat, and even drowned Nature by the continual Droppings of his Exceſs; and by all this brought himſelf to the brink of the Pit; then at length he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſenſible of the great Evil, and the woful Conſequents of his intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Courſes; then he cries out againſt himſelf, that he ſhould ever be ſuch a Beaſt as he hath been; that he ſhould by his Exceſs ruine his Family, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf both Soul and Body. In ſhort, Afflictions are a kind of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eye-ſalve whereby our Sight is cleared, and we are enabled to ſee what
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:61506:186"/>we ſaw not before we were afflicted; and to ſee thoſe things more clearly and diſtinctly, which before we ſaw darkly and confuſedly. Afflictions help us to ſee thoſe Sins in our ſelves which before we diſcerned not; or if we had ſome obſcure and imperfect Sight of them, if we had a dark and confuſed View of them before we were afflicted, our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions help us to ſee them, and to diſcern the Evil and Danger of them more clearly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Afflictions put us upon the great and neceſſary Duties of Humiliation and Prayer. Afflictions make us humble our ſelves for our Sins, by which we have brought our Afflictions upon us; and they make us earneſt Suitors to God in Prayer for the Pardon of our Sins, and for the Removal of thoſe our Afflictions which have been the bitter Fruit of our Sins. Afflictions have often taught Men to humble themſelves and pray, who were mere Strangers to thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before, and never had any Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them till God's afflicting Hand was upon them. Even the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, a Generation of Men that for the moſt part do not much addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Devotion, will pray, and call
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:61506:187"/>upon God in a Tempeſt, as we may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. where both their Danger and their Carriage therein is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 107.25, 26, 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>He commandeth and raiſeth the ſtormy Winds, which lift up the Waves: they mount up to the Heavens, they go down again to the deep; their Soul is melted becauſe of Trouble; they reel to and fro, and ſtagger like a drunken Man, and are at their Wits and: Then they cry unto the Lord in their Trouble, and he bringeth them out of their Diſtreſſes.</hi> So <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.5. The Mariners being afraid, by reaſon of a mighty Tempeſt, <hi>cried every Man unto his God.</hi> So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith of the Jews;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.16.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, in Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have they viſited thee; they pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a Prayer when thy Chaſtning was upon them.</hi> And this is that which God aims at in afflicting his People; <hi>I will go and return to my Place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.15.</note> that is, I will withdraw from them, ſaith he, <hi>till they acknowledg their Offence, and ſeek my Face.</hi> This here in my Text was the Effect which Affliction took upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh; When he was in Affliction, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and prayed unto him.</hi> This Courſe St. <hi>James</hi> directs the Afflicted unto: <hi>Is
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:61506:187"/>any among you afflicted? let him pray.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 5.13.</note> To the like Purpoſe is the Exhortation of St. <hi>Peter</hi> to ſuch as are caſt down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the afflicting Hand of God;
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.6.</note> 
               <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Afflictions make Men willing to forſake their Sins, and induce them to take up Reſolutions to forſake them, and caſt them off. The beloved Sins of Men are ſweet to them, and they are moſt unwilling to leave them as long as they can enjoy them without Trouble or Moleſtation, as long as they ſuffer nothing, and as they ſmart not upon the account of their Sins: But when they are chaſtned and afflicted for their Sins, this makes Sin bitter to them, and makes them reſolve to part with it, to caſt it off, and abandon it; this makes them bind and oblige themſelves by the moſt ſolemn and ſacred Bonds never to return to it any more. This is that which God's People were to do in the time of their Affliction; they muſt reſolve upon other Courſes, they muſt promiſe and vow to renounce and forſake thoſe Sins by which they had drawn down the Judgments of God upon them; they muſt return to the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:61506:188"/>Lord, and ſay unto him, Aſher <hi>ſhall not ſave us;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.3.</note> 
               <hi>we will not ride upon Horſes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we ſay any more to the Works of our hands, Ye are our Gods.</hi> Theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions their Afflictions ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and ſuch Reſolutions they would produce, when their Sufferings, being ſanctified to them, ſhould effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, and bring them home to God. And the like Reſolutions did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Afflictions produce in him, as we may gather from the frequent mention there is of the Vows which he then made unto God: <hi>Thy Vows are upon me, O God: I will render Praiſe unto thee,</hi> Pſal. 56.12. <hi>Thou, O God, hast heard my Vows,</hi> Pſal. 61.5. <hi>Prepare Mercy and Truth which may preſerve me: So will I ſing Praiſe unto thee for ever, that I may daily perform my Vows,</hi> ver. 7, 8. <hi>I will pay thee my Vows which my Lips have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and my Mouth hath ſpoken when I was in Trouble,</hi> Pſal. 66.13, 14. Now by theſe his Vows no doubt but he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged himſelf to teſtify his Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto God when he ſhould deliver him out of his Troubles, not only by offering Sacrifices, which were the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Teſtifications of Thankfulneſs in thoſe times, but alſo by a more careful
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:61506:188"/>Endeavour to forſake all Sin, and to give up himſelf to God more intirely in a way of conſtant and univerſal O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, without which all their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Oblations had in God's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſignified little.</p>
            <p>The Sum of all that hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, is this: Afflictions will work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men, and prevail with them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God from whom they have gone aſtray, when all other Means are inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. That 'tis not from any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Property or inherent Virtue in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions themſelves that they produce this Effect, but from the Grace of God, and the Operation of his Spirit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying Afflictions, and ſanctifying them to us. That Afflictions, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Afflictions, contribute towards the reclaiming of Sinners. (1.) By making them more ſerious, and by cauſing them to reflect upon themſelves, and conſider. (2.) By bringing them to the ſight of their Sins, which they do ſeveral ways. (3.) By acquainting them with the great Evil and Hainouſneſs of Sin, and with the Danger thereof. (4.) By putting the Sinner upon Humiliation and Prayer. (5.) By making him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:61506:189"/>to forſake his Sins, and by cauſing him to take up Reſolutions to forſake his Sins, and never to return to them any more.</p>
            <p>Now I come to apply what hath been ſpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If Afflictions will work upon Men, and prevail with them to return to God, when all other-Means are inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; this may inform us how en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely bad we are, what ſinful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we have; how diſingenuous we are, how much our Hearts are ſet upon Sin, and how fondly in love with it we are. 'Tis a very bad Child, that will be wrought upon and be made better by nothing but the Rod: if no Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, no wholſom Counſels, no Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, no Promiſes, no Threatnings will do him any good; if he muſt be beaten and ſmart ſoundly, or he will miſcarry and undo himſelf. This is our natural Temper, this is the very Caſe of us all by Nature; nothing but Blows, and the Smart of the Rod will take off our Hearts from Sin, and make us wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave it. How ſhould it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and abaſe us, and cauſe us even to loath our ſelves, that we ſhould have
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:61506:189"/>ſuch wicked and vile Natures, that we ſhould be ſo diſingenuous; and that there ſhould be ſuch a curſed League between us and Sin; that we ſhould have ſo much Kindneſs and intire Friendſhip and Affection for Sin, which is moſt odious to God, and moſt deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to our own Souls!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. If Afflictions will work upon Men, and prevail, with them to return to God from whom they have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, when all other Means are ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual; this ſhould reconcile us to Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and make us willing to ſubmit to that ſpiritual Diſcipline which the moſt wiſe God thinks fit to train us up under for our Good. Why ſhould you murmur and fret againſt the Lord, when his chaſtning: Hand is upon you? Why ſhould your Heart riſe againſt that wholſom and neceſſary. Severity, which he makes uſe of for reclaiming you? Is there not a Cauſe? Doth he not ſee that nothing elſe will prevail with you? What would you have him do? Would you have him let you alone, and ſuffer you to periſh in your Sins? Be not ſo in love with your preſent Eaſt; as to be unwilling to ſuffer a little here, to
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:61506:190"/>prevent your ſuffering eternally in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. Be not ſo fondly, fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, irrationally, and madly in love with Sin, as to be averſe from undergoing any thing whereby you may be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Power and Dominion of it. Have not ſuch mean, low and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Thoughts of the great and ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Mercy of being reduced from the Error of your Ways, and brought home unto God, as to think much of any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity by which it may be effected. Certainly if you judg Sin to be the greateſt Evil, and if you be really of the mind that 'tis the greateſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be freed from it, and to be at Peace with God, and to be reconciled to him, you will not think any Courſe harſh, grievous and intolerable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be attained.</p>
            <p>I now come to a more particular Conſideration of what <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did in his Affliction; <hi>He beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words we are informed what <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did: Firſt, in general Terms, <hi>He beſought the Lord his God;</hi>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:61506:190"/>and then we are more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how he ſought him, namely, by Humiliation and Prayer; <hi>He hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and he prayed unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the Account in general of what <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did, in thoſe words, <hi>He beſought the Lord his God,</hi> I ſhall ſay nothing, becauſe there is nothing in thoſe general Terms, but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the following Particulars, namely, <hi>that he humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>He humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers.</hi> In which Words there are three things conſiderable; <hi>That he humbled himſelf; That he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf greatly;</hi> and <hi>that he humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>He humbled himſelf:</hi> But when was it that he humbled himſelf? It was when God had firſt humbled him, and not till then; when God had delivered him into the Hands of his Enemies; when God had cauſed him to be carried away captive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> made him a Priſoner, and put him in durance there, from whence he knew not whether he
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:61506:191"/>ſhould ever be releaſed, and ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty again. Whence we may obſerve, <hi>That proud, ſtubborn and incorrigible Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will not humble themſelves till God hath humbled them, till by Afflictions he hath taken down their haughty Spirits and laid them low.</hi> Wherefore you who turn the deaf Ear to all God's gracious Calls and Invitations to Repentance, and to all his ſevere Denunciations of Judgments, would you prevent God's humbling you by thoſe ſharp and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Afflictions which would be very grievous to you; then humble your ſelves betimes, before he takes you in hand to humble you. This is the beſt Courſe, or rather the only Courſe that you can take for preventing God's humbling you:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note> for <hi>if we would judg our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged.</hi> When <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> lay under God's afflicting Hand, then he humbled himſelf. The Time of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is the moſt proper Seaſon for Humiliation. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, if ever, we ſee our Sins; our Afflictions open our Eyes, make us look about us, and help us to diſcover thoſe our Miſcarriages, which before we would not own nor take notice of.</p>
            <pb n="365" facs="tcp:61506:191"/>
            <p n="2">2. Then the Heart is ſoftned, and touched with the ſenſe of our Sins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then alſo the Sinner begins to have a ſenſe of God's Diſpleaſure againſt him for his Sins: By the Afflictions which the Hand of God hath laid upon him, he perceives that God is angry with him, which he was not in the leaſt ſenſible of before he was afflicted. Now all theſe things do not a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Humiliation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us therefore when Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come upon us, improve that Seaſon for our Humiliation; elſe all thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages will be loſt.</p>
            <p>Now if you ask how we are to be active in humbling our ſelves? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By making diligent ſearch after our Sins, by labouring to find them out, and acquaint our ſelves with them: And this is no eaſy Work, conſidering our natural Blindneſs in ſpiritual things, our Unwillingneſs to know the worſt of our ſelves, our Partiality to our ſelves, and our Aptneſs to overlook our Sins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By uſing our beſt Endeavours to affect our Hearts with our Sins, which is to be done by a ſerious Conſideration
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:61506:192"/>of the Nature, Quality and Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Sins; as alſo of the extreme Danger attending them, and of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Conſequents of Sin unrepented of, and the moſt fearful and eternal Wrath of God which it unavoidably expoſeth the Sinner unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By humble and affectionate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Sins unto God, with our moſt earneſt and importunate Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him for the pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By judging our ſelves for them, and by paſſing Sentence againſt our ſelves, as thoſe who have by our Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations deſerved to be diſowned and caſt off for ever, and to be made the miſerable Objects of God's fierce Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Eternity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By taking up the moſt firm and ſtedfaſt Reſolutions to caſt off all our Tranſgreſſions for the time to come, and as far as God ſhall be pleaſed by his Grace to enable us, never to return to Folly any more.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the ſecond Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>He humbled himſelf greatly,</hi> as he had been a very great and moſt heinous Sinner. And hence we may farther obſerve,</p>
            <pb n="367" facs="tcp:61506:192"/>
            <p>
               <hi>That our Humiliation must be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the Nature and Quality of our Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little ſlight Humiliation for great and grievous Sins, is in God's account next to no Humiliation at all. Let not therefore ſuch as have been guilty of great and horrid Sins, think it is enough for them to have <hi>hang'd down their Heads as a Bulruſh for a day or two;</hi> as thoſe Hypocrites whoſe Carriage the Prophet deſcribes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 58.5. or to have made ſome ſlight and formal Confeſſion of their Sins, when they are now juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to go out of the World. This for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and half-Humiliation cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; for it argues that ſuch a Man hath neither any true ſenſe of the Hainouſneſs of his Sins, nor of the high Diſpleaſure of God againſt him for his Sins, much leſs any ſincere and firm Reſolutions to forſake his Sins, if God ſhould raiſe him up again, and lengthen out his Life for ſome longer time. That you may be duly and ſoundly humbled for your Sins,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Give your ſelf no Reſt until you be fully convinced of the hainous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of your Sins, and the various Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of them by which they have been heightned: As,</p>
            <pb n="368" facs="tcp:61506:193"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) That your Sins have been ſo often repeated, renewed, and acted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again and again.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That they have been committed againſt ſo many Cautions againſt them as you have had, againſt ſo many Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo many Admonitions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Againſt ſo many Chaſtiſements, and ſo much Experience of the bitter Fruits of Sin.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Againſt ſo many Mercies which ſhould have led you to Repentance.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) That they have been committed againſt ſo many Purpoſes and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, againſt ſo many Promiſes and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ingagements to the contrary, and perhaps againſt ſo many ſolemn Vows and Covenants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Acquaint your ſelf with the Threatnings of God againſt thoſe your Sins, and the high Diſpleaſure of God therein manifeſted againſt you for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be an humble Suitor unto God, that he would be pleaſed to break your Heart, and according to his Promiſe, <hi>to take away your ſtony Heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 36.26.</note> 
               <hi>and give you a Heart of Fleſh.</hi> But be ſure that you be in good earneſt when you offer
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:61506:193"/>up this Suit unto God; beg this Mercy with the greateſt Importunity, or other ways never expect to obtain it; then, and then only ſhall you ſeek God and find him,
<note place="margin">Jer. 29.13.</note> when you ſhall <hi>ſearch for him with all your Heart.</hi> And though you ſhould not preſently obtain what you ſeek unto God for, yet give not over ſeeking him; if you ſeek him with Conſtancy and Perſeverance, you ſhall be ſure to ſpeed in the End:
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.9.</note> 
               <hi>In due time you ſhall reap, if you faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay, How may a Man know that he is truly and ſoundly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that his Humiliation bears ſome Proportion with the Quality and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his Sins?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He that is truly, effectually and ſoundly humbled, will loath and abhor himſelf for his Sins; ſo did <hi>Job: Behold, I am vile,</hi> ſaith he,
<note place="margin">Job 40.4.</note> 
               <hi>what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my Hand upon my Mouth.</hi> And again; <hi>I abhor my ſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 42.6.</note> ſaith he, <hi>and repent in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi> This is that Frame of Spirit which God expects ſhould be found in a ſincerely penitent, truly humbled, and effectually reformed People; they ſhould <hi>remember and be confounded,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 16.63.</note> 
               <hi>and never open their Mouth any more:</hi> that is, they ſhould
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:61506:194"/>remember all their Abominations, be confounded in the ſerious Thoughts and Remembrance of them, and never open their Mouth any more to juſtify them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that is truly, effectually and ſoundly humbled, will freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and aggravate his Sins; he will be ſo far from extenuating and leſſening his Sins, that he will lay them open and repreſent them as fully as he can, and in his Confeſſions of them lay all the load on himſelf that he is able; he will not ſpare himſelf, or in the leaſt favour himſelf in the Charge and Indictment which he brings in againſt himſelf. Thus <hi>David</hi> making Acknowledgment of his Sin, gives it its full Aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.10.</note> ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned greatly, and I have done very fooliſhly.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when he ſaw the Angel of the Lord ſtretching out his Hand againſt the People,
<note place="margin">Ver. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Lo, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly: but as for theſe Sheep what have they done? Let thy Hand, I pray thee, be againſt me, and againſt my Father's Houſe.</hi> An unhumbled Sinner would have ſhifted off all the Blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, as did <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.15. excuſing himſelf, he pleaded, that <hi>the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:61506:194"/>People had ſpared the beſt of the Sheep, and the Oxen, to ſacrifice unto the Lord:</hi> But <hi>David</hi> took all the Blame upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and wholly exempts his People from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Sinner that is truly, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſoundly humbled, will juſtify God in all that is come upon him for his Sins: So <hi>Daniel</hi> acknowledging his own Sins, and the Sins of the People, ſaith, <hi>To thee, O Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 9.7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>belongeth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; but to us Confuſion of Face, to our Kings, to our Princes, and to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> This Acknowledgment he makes after a long Recital of thoſe heavy Judgments which for their Sins God had inflicted on them, thereby clearing him from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny unjuſt Severity which he had exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon them. To the ſame purpoſe it is that <hi>Ezra</hi> making Confeſſion of his own Sins, and of the Sins of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, freely acknowledged, that though they had ſuffered grievous things, yet they had been <hi>puniſhed leſs than their Iniquities deſerved.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 9.13.</note> God had in Wrath remembred Mercy, even when he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with moſt Severity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Sinner that is truly, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and ſoundly humbled, will meekly
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:61506:195"/>and patiently ſubmit to God's Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and lay himſelf at the Feet of God while he is chaſtning him. He will accept of the Puniſhment of his Sin, as the Phraſe is, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.41. He will cordially ſay with the Church;
<note place="margin">Micah 7.9.</note> 
               <hi>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſinned againſt him.</hi> He will humbly ſay with <hi>Eli,</hi> whatſoever his Sufferings are, It is the Lord that thus handles me;
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> In like manner <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth his humble Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the good Pleaſure of God, when he lay under his correcting Hand; when he fled from <hi>Abſalom,</hi> he ordered the Ark to be by <hi>Zabok</hi> carried back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City,
<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Sam. 15.25, 26.</note> ſaying, <hi>If I ſhall find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in the Eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ſhew me both it, and his Habitation: But if he thus ſay, I have no Delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Sinner that is truly, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and ſoundly troubled, will take a holy Revenge upon himſelf, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe things, to thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Inſtances of his Life, in which he has moſt provoked God and incurred his Diſpleaſure.
<note place="margin">Cor. 7.11</note> To manifeſt his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61506:195"/>againſt himſelf for the Sins by which he hath moſt highly diſhonoured God, he will deny himſelf ſome of thoſe lawful and innocent Liberties which he might other ways without Sin make uſe of.</p>
            <p>It now follows in the Text, that <hi>he humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers.</hi> Which Words may imply either an Aggravation of his Sins, or an Incouragement to ſeek unto God for the Pardon of his Sins.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Words may imply an Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Sins, which had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt ſo many Conſiderations as might and ſhould have effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained him from ſinning againſt God in ſuch a fearful manner as he had done.</p>
            <p>As, 1ſt. That he had ſinned againſt ſo many good Inſtructions and Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt Sin, as his Father had given him; and againſt the pious Education which under the Care and Inſpection of ſo religious and conſcientious a Father he had enjoyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. That he had ſinned againſt all the good Examples which his Father and other religious Progenitors had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61506:196"/>him, and againſt all the Patterns of ſincere Godlineſs and true Piety which they had laid before him, and either were or ſhould have been ſtill in his Eye.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. That he had ſinned at ſuch a fearful rate, and indulged himſelf in ſuch vile and profligate Courſes, againſt all the Advantages, for better things, which all the Prayers of his Father and other godly Anceſtors had afforded him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let all wicked and graceleſs Children of pious and religious Parents, conſider ſeriouſly how ſad their Account muſt needs be another Day, if they ſhall ſtill go on and perſevere in thoſe wicked and ungodly ways unto which they addict themſelves; they muſt not think to plead the Piety of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parents and other Anceſtors; this ſhall be ſo far from being any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them, that it will be found to be the greateſt Aggravation of their Sins, and accordingly procure the moſt fearful Aggravation and Heightning of their Puniſhment. The moſt wicked Children are apt to pleaſe and flatter themſelves with this fond Imagination, that being deſcended from ſuch good Parents and Anceſtors, they ſhall for
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:61506:196"/>their ſakes find Favour with God at the Great Day of their Account; and that the Children of ſuch Parents and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, though they ſhould have lived irregularly, cannot eaſily miſcarry and periſh everlaſtingly. Let not wicked Children of good Parents deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; if they continue and perſevere ſtill in their evil ways, they muſt know (and I deſire all ſuch to ponder it ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) that the Piety of their Parents will be of no other Advantage to them, than only to riſe up in Judgment againſt them, and to condemn them with a more ſore and dreadful Condemnation. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt calling upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly to break off their wicked Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and to <hi>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> tells them, that they muſt not think to ſay within themſelves,
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father; for God</hi> was <hi>able even of Stones to raiſe up Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unto</hi> Abraham. <hi>Abraham</hi> wanted no ſuch Children as they were, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were a Diſhonour and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to their godly Anceſtors: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> would never own ſuch a wicked Poſterity for his Children, much leſs would he open his Mouth to ſpeak one Word in their Behalf when they ſhould
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:61506:197"/>ſtand before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, to be accountable to him for all their Wickedneſs. The true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> are only thoſe who imitate <hi>Abraham,</hi> and tread in his Steps; as for others he will utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſown and diſclaim them. And the ſame Treatment muſt all wicked Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſtill continuing ſo to be, expect from their godly Parents and Anceſtors; they muſt not think to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Judgments of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Piety of their Progenitors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Words may imply an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſeek unto God for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Sins, and a great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereunto it is upon ſeveral Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The Children of good Men are, together with their Parents, within the Compaſs of the Covenant which God makes and eſtabliſheth with his People: Thus runs the Tenour of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> 
               <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>betwixt me and thee, and thy Seed after thee in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy Seed after thee.</hi> By this St. <hi>Peter</hi> incourageth the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:61506:197"/>wicked Jews that had ſtained their Hands with the horrid Guilt of crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord of Life: I ſay, by this he encouraged them to Repentance for the Remiſſion of their Sins;

               <hi>For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is unto you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Godly Parents make Conſcience of praying for their Children, that God would be pleaſed to pardon their Sins, to ſtrengthen them againſt their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to beſtow his Grace and holy Spirit upon them. This Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, if duly weighed, muſt needs be a ſingular Encouragement, even to the moſt wicked and ungodly Children, to become humble and earneſt Suitors unto God for the Pardon of their Sins: they may upon good Grounds hope, that all the Prayers and Supplications which their Parents have offered up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for them, ſhall not utterly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry and be loſt.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This may inform us how great a Mercy it is for Children to have been deſcended from pious and religious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and how thankful unto God they ought to be for this ſingular Favour, a
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:61506:198"/>Favour that cannot be ſufficiently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and which hath its riſe purely from the free Grace of God, which alone maketh one Man to differ from another, eſpecially in Matters of this Nature, wherein the eternal Welfare of our Souls is ſo nearly concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Let all ſuch Children who have been favoured with this ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Privilege of being deſcended from religious Parents, improve this Mercy to their ſpiritual Advantage, giving all Diligence to become Followers of their Parents, and Imitators of their Piety; to write after that Copy, and to work after that Pattern which their Parents have ſet them: And let them pray unto God fervently and inceſſantly, that they may by a holy and unblamable Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, approve themſelves to be the true Offspring of ſuch Parents, and be accordingly owned and acknowledged by them; and above all, that they may be owned and acknowledged of God for ſuch, when they ſhall give up their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to him, and receive their final Sentence <hi>according to what they have done,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.10</note> in the Fleſh, <hi>whether it be Good or Evil.</hi> And thus I have done with that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
            <pb n="379" facs="tcp:61506:198"/>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is, what <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> joined with his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the afflicting Hand of God, namely, Prayer; <hi>He humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence we may obſerve, in the next Place, that Prayer is a ſeaſonable and neceſſary Duty in the time of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Is any among you afflicted?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 5.13.</note> 
               <hi>let him pray.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.15</note> Call upon me in the Day of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> This God aims at in afflicting us, and hiding his Face from us: This is his Deſign in withdrawing his gracious Preſence from us:
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5.15.</note> 
               <hi>I will go and return to my Place,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>till they acknowledg their Offence, and ſeek my Face: in their Affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> Thus did God's People in the time of their Afflictions:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.16.</note> 
               <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>in Trouble they have viſited thee: they poured out a Prayer, when thy Chaſtning was upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And divers Reaſons there are why all God's People ſhould in their Afflictions betake themſelves to God by Prayer. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Afflictions come from God; <hi>I form Light,</hi> ſaith he,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 45.7.</note> 
               <hi>and create Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I make Peace, and create Evil; I
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:61506:199"/>the Lord do all theſe things. Shall there be Evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Amos 3.6. Which Words muſt be underſtood of the Evil of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and Puniſhment, not of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of Sin, that's an Evil whereof God who is perfectly and infinitely Good, can never be the Author. Men may be Inſtruments in our Sufferings, they may be Actors in ſubjecting us to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and in bringing ſuch Evils up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; but it is God that imploys them, and makes uſe of them to chaſten his People for their Sins. This is that which the Pſalmiſt intends when he calls wicked Men <hi>God's Sword;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 17.13</note> 
               <hi>Deliver my Soul from the Wicked,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which is thy Sword:</hi> The Sword where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he thruſts at, wounds and pierceth, chaſtens and corrects his People, when they have by their Provocations incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Diſpleaſure. To the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is that he calls <hi>Aſſyria</hi> the Rod of his Anger,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 10.5.</note> and the Staff in their Hand his Indignation; that is, the Inſtrument of his Indignation which he makes uſe of to puniſh them for their Sins. Hence alſo it is that he calls the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> his <hi>Battel-Axe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 51.20.</note> and <hi>Weapons of War,</hi> with which <hi>he breaks in pieces
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:61506:199"/>the Nations, and deſtroyeth Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe God only can remove thoſe Afflictions from his People, which his Hand hath laid upon them: This God aſſumes to himſelf as his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative;
<note place="margin">Deut. 32.39.</note> 
               <hi>I kill</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of my Hand.</hi> To the ſame Effect is that Paſſage in the Song of <hi>Hannah,</hi> where ſhe ſaith,

               <hi>The Lord killeth and maketh alive; he bringeth down to the Grave, and bringeth up.</hi> And that of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.20. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto God the Lord belong the Iſſues from Death.</hi> Hence God himſelf complains of Mens neglecting to have Recourſe to him by Prayer in their Afflictions, who alone can relieve them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving his afflicting Hand from them; ſaying,
<note place="margin">Jer. 9.13</note> 
               <hi>The People turneth not to him that ſmiteth them; neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Neglect to have Recourſe to God by Prayer in our Afflictions, blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all other Means which we make uſe of for our Relief. No Queſtion can be made of it, but that <hi>Ahaziah</hi> having taken a dangerous Fall from a Lattice, made uſe of all the beſt Means that could be had for his Cure; but becauſe
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:61506:200"/>in that his Affliction he ſought not unto the true God, the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for healing, but unto the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> the Prophet in the Name of God tells him, that he ſhould <hi>not come down from that Bed on which he had gone up,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 1.4</note> but ſhould <hi>furely die,</hi> as accordingly it fell out in the Iſſue. Wherefore this is noted as a great Miſcarriage in <hi>Aſa</hi> (though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a good Man) that in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 16.12.</note> even when it was very grievous, he ſought unto the Phyſicians, and not unto God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It concerns us in our Afflictions to ſeek unto God by Prayer, in regard of the great need we have of his Help and Aſſiſtance many other ways in the time of our Afflictions. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. To teach us his meaning in thoſe Afflictions with which he exerciſeth us; what he deſigns in them; and what at ſuch a time he expects from us.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. To ſanctify Afflictions to us, and to enable us to improve them to our ſpiritual Advantage.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. To ſupport us under our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. To give us Patience under his afflicting Hand, and to keep us from murmuring, repining, diſcontent, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:61506:200"/>againſt God, and all other ſinful Diſtempers, which in regard of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Nature, and the evil Frame of our Hearts, we are ſubject unto in our Afflictions.</p>
            <p>Theſe Particulars I have only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, leaving it to every Man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large on them in his private Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Seeing we are upon ſo many Conſiderations obliged and highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſeek unto God in our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, let us all be cautioned to take heed that we neglect not the Duty of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er while God's afflicting Hand is upon us, and when, if ever, this Duty is both moſt ſeaſonable and moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As ſoon as ever any Affliction from the Hand of God begins to light on us, let us immediately betake our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God by Prayer; let this be the firſt thing we do, and let us never think of making uſe of any other means in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Relief, till this be done: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us reſt here, but let us continue to pray without ceaſing, as long as God thinks good to continue his afflicting Hand upon us and ours. Thus doing with Conſtancy and Perſeverance, we
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:61506:201"/>need not queſtion but that we ſhall ſee a good Iſſue out of our Afflictions, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, in God's appointed time; but in all our Afflictions let us not only pray, but labour to be ſoundly humbled for our Sins, which have been the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Cauſe of all our Sufferings; let us earneſtly beg the Pardon of them, and Strength againſt them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This is the beſt Courſe that we can take in our Afflictions, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Courſe that can give us any Security, that we ſhall be in due time delivered out of our Afflictions, and be delivered with ſuch Advantages to our Souls, as ſhall give us juſt Cauſe to acknowledg that it hath been good for us to have been afflicted; and that God hath in Faithfulneſs chaſtned us, as <hi>David,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Afflictions, profeſſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75.</p>
            <p>Now follows the fifth Particular, namely, the Iſſue of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>'s Prayer; <hi>God was entreated of him, and heard his Supplication, and brought him again to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>into his Kingdom. Then</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh <hi>knew that the Lord he was God.</hi> Moſt ſad and doleful was the Condition of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> while he was a Captive
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:61506:201"/>in <hi>Babylon;</hi> he was bound with Chains, and fettered with Irons; he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the dark and uncomfortable Vaults and Cloyſters of a Priſon; and though perhaps in regard that he was not of the common ſort of Priſoners, but a King, he might have better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations than many others; yet which was worſt of all, he had ſmall or no Hopes of being ever releaſed or ſet at Liberty again; and which was the Height of his Miſery, he had no Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for his Life, but was perpetually in Danger, and upon that Account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fears of being drawn out of Priſon, and brought to Execution every Day and every Hour. This was his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and deſperate Condition, than which nothing could eaſily be more ſad and rueful; but notwithſtanding all this God wonderfully appeared for him, and reſcued him out of his Miſery.</p>
            <p>And hence we may obſerve;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there is no Condition ſo ſad, ſo diſconſolate, and ſo diſmal, but that God can afford a Man Relief therein, and will do it if he be duly ſought unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonah</hi> upon Prayer was delivered out of the <hi>Belly of Hell,</hi> as he calls it;
<note place="margin">Jonah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> dark Priſon, or rather a Dungeon.
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:61506:202"/>When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould by their Sins have ſo far provoked God as to be made the Objects of his fierceſt Indignation, and to be puniſhed ſeven times and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times, and ſeven times more for their Iniquities; yet after all this, God promiſed them Mercy upon their ſound Humiliation,
<note place="margin">Lev. 26.40, 41, 42.</note> and ſincere Repentance. So again, when all the Curſes of the Law ſhould have overtaken and ſeized on that ſinful People; and when for their monſtrous Provocations God ſhould have diſperſed them, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them amongſt the Nations, and driven them even to the uttermoſt Parts of the Earth; yet if after all this they ſhould return to the Lord, and obey his Voice,
<note place="margin">Deut. 30.2, 3, 4.</note> he promiſeth to turn their Captivity, and to gather them out of all Places whither he had ſcattered them. He is graciouſly pleaſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them, that if any of theirs ſhould be driven out to the uttermoſt Parts of Heaven, from thence would the Lord their God gather them, and from thence would he fetch them.</p>
            <p>There are two Branches of this Point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He can afford Relief in the moſt deplorable and deſperate Caſes, for he
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:61506:202"/>is all-ſufficient;
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note> He wants neither Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor Power to compaſs and work out the Deliverance of his People, how forlorn or deplorable ſoever their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ſeem to be.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. As for Wiſdom; <hi>He is the only wiſe God,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.17. <hi>His <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is infinite,</hi> Pſal. 147.5. <hi>He knows how to deliver the Godly,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. His Power is equal to his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Nothing is impoſſible with God,</hi> Luke 1.37. <hi>Nothing is too hard for him,</hi> Gen. 18.14. <hi>He is able to do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think,</hi> Eph. 3.20. He is never at a Loſs, though we be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As he can, ſo he will afford Relief in all Caſes, if he be duly ſought unto, at leaſt ſo far as ſhall be moſt for his own Glory, and our real Benefit and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The more ſad any Man's Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, the more ready is he to relieve him,
<note place="margin">Pſal, 103.13.</note> and the greater Compaſſion hath he for him: <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The more ſad any Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, the more Glory will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:61506:203"/>to God from relieving him.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this in a Word. The proper Uſe of this Point is to incourage us to look up to God, and to be humble Petitioners to him for Relief in all our Diſtreſſes, never deſpairing of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Succour as long as we have ſuch an one to have recourſe unto.</p>
            <p>But to go on with the Text, which informs us, that <hi>God was entreated of him, and heard his Supplication, and brought him again to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>into his Kingdom.</hi> He was entreated of him, not only ſo as to releaſe him out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to bring him back again into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> into his Kingdom, but ſo as to pardon his great and hainous Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, by which he had drawn that Miſery upon himſelf: for that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> was a true Penitent, we have all the reaſon to believe, not only in regard that it is ſaid of him, that <hi>he humbled himſelf greatly,</hi> but alſo that upon his Return to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> he <hi>took away the ſtrange Gods and the Idol out of the Houſe of the Lord, and all the Altars that he had built, and caſt them out of the City, and commanded</hi> Judah <hi>to ſerve the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael. Theſe were Fruits and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Truth of his Repentance.</p>
            <pb n="389" facs="tcp:61506:203"/>
            <p>Now whereas ſuch an one as <hi>Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh</hi> obtained the Pardon of his Sins; we may obſerve, <hi>That the greateſt Sinners may find Mercy with God if they duly ſeek it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This great Truth (for ſuch it will be deemed by all that are truly ſenſible of their Sins) may be confirmed ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From Inſtances of ſuch notorious Sinners as have upon their Repentance obtained the pardon of their Sins. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whereof are,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> here in the Text, whoſe moſt hainous and abominable Provocations are at large deſcribed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Woman mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37, 38. and ſo on to the end of the Chapter. This Woman is there ſaid to have been a Sinner, that is, a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and infamous Sinner; one that was known to be a lewd and vitious Woman all the Town over; inſomuch that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Phariſee, who had invited Chriſt to his Houſe, took great offence at it, that he ſhould ſuffer a Woman of ſuch ill Report to come near him, as we may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 39. and yet this lewd and vicious Woman, upon her ſincere
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:61506:204"/>Repentance, obtained the forgiveneſs of her Sins, whereof our Saviour aſſures her, <hi>ver.</hi> 48. ſaying unto her, <hi>Thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Thief on the Croſs, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance of Mercy obtained at the Hands of God by a great Sinner, upon his ſound Humiliation and unfeigned Repentance; <hi>Luke</hi> 23.40, 41, 42, 43.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Another Inſtance hereof may be in thoſe who are ſaid <hi>to have uſed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 19.19</note> that is, who addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto Magick and Judicial Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. Many of theſe are ſaid to have brought their Books together, (that is, their Books of Magick and Judicial A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology) and to have <hi>burned them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Men,</hi> thereby teſtifying the truth of their Repentance; upon which, without all queſtion, they obtained the pardon of thoſe their great and horrible Offences.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Another Inſtance may be in thoſe notorious Sinners, a black Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue whereof we have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. namely, <hi>Fornicators, Idolaters, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Effeminate, Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, Thieves, Covetous, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Revilers, Extortioners.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which monſtrous and prodigious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:61506:204"/>the Apoſtle adds, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>And ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God.</hi> The Sum of all is, That as bad as they were, and as notoriouſly wicked as they had been, they obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed converting, pardoning and ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be another Inſtance hereof, who though (according to his own acknowledgment) he had been <hi>a Blaſphemer, a Perſecuter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.13, 15.</note> 
               <hi>an injurious Perſon, and the chief of Sinners;</hi> yet upon his <hi>Repentance he obtained Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) Another Inſtance may be in thoſe wicked Jews that crucified the Lord of Life; three thouſand whereof being converted by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.36, — 41.</note> obtained the forgiveneſs of that horrid Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That great Sinners may upon ſound and ſincere Repentance obtain the pardon and forgiveneſs of their Sins, may be confirmed ſeveral other ways: As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe Mercy is promiſed to the greateſt Sinners, upon their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. &amp; 55.7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.27, 28. &amp; 30.31, 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31.</p>
            <pb n="392" facs="tcp:61506:205"/>
            <p n="2">(2.) Promiſes of Pardon made unto penitent and believing Sinners, run in general Terms; <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Chriſt invites all that feel the Burden of their Sins, to come unto him, promiſing them Eaſe and Refreſhing if they come; <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Chriſt expoſtulates with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and complains that they come not to him for Mercy; <hi>John</hi> 5.40. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) He declareth and profeſſeth that he will reject and put off none that ſhall come unto him; <hi>John</hi> 6.37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This Truth is Matter of very great Encouragement to the chief of Sinners to come to Chriſt, and to be humble Suitors to him for the pardon of their Sins. They ſee that pardoning Mercy has been obtained by many of the greateſt Sinners, that the Promiſes of finding Mercy with God upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Faith and Repentance, run in general Terms, excluding none that are ſo qualified: they ſee that Chriſt moſt graciouſly invites all ſorts of labouring and heavy-laden Sinners, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:61506:205"/>to come unto him; that he expoſtulates with Sinners, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that they will not come unto him that they may have Life: and laſtly, that he declareth and profeſſeth that he will caſt out none that come unto him, that come unto him in a due manner, and as they ought to come; that is to ſay, with unfeigned and ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for their Sins paſt, and with firm Reſolutions and ſincere Endeavours to caſt off and forſake their Sins for the time to come. Now what more can the greateſt Sinners wiſh or deſire, to encourage them to ſeek Mercy at the Hands of God, than that they may reſt aſſured that they ſhall not loſe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that they ſhall not ſeek him in vain, but certainly obtain what they are Suitors to him for? But here how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they muſt be careful to ſeek him, (1.) Seaſonably; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.15. (2.) Earneſtly and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately; this manner of ſeeking God is that which prevails with him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we ſeek unto him for ſo great a thing as is the forgiveneſs of our Sins; <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.13. (3.) Abandoning, forſaking and caſting off all their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.30.</note> 
               <hi>that Iniquity may not be their
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:61506:206"/>Ruine.</hi> If thus they come unto Chriſt, and ſeek Mercy at his Hands, (as hath been ſaid before) Chriſt will in no wiſe turn them off with a Repulſe, but aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly and without fail entertain them graciouſly, and give them to find Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with him in the pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Sins.</p>
            <p>But here deſponding and diſcouraged Sinners be apt to object ſeveral things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Saith the Sinner that is deeply affected and ſadly caſt down with the ſenſe of his Sins, <hi>None ever obtained Mercy, that ſinned as I have done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1.) That is a very raſh and unadviſed Speech, (as I have elſewhere ſhewed at large:) Do you know all the Sins which all the penitent Sinners that ever found Mercy with God, have been guilty of?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Conſider and ponder a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Inſtances before-mentioned. Are your Sins greater than the Sins of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh?</hi> Are your Sins greater than the Sins of that Woman,
<note place="margin">Luk. 7.37, 38.</note> who was notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for her Lewdneſs all the City over? Are your Sins greater than the Sins of all thoſe foul and abominable Sinners, which the Apoſtle reckons up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10?</p>
            <pb n="395" facs="tcp:61506:206"/>
            <p n="3">(3.) If your Sins have been really greater than the Sins of any of theſe, or all of them together; yet are they greater than the boundleſs Mercies of God, and the Merits of Chriſt? Take heed how you entertain ſuch a Thought.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Are your Sins ſo great, as that they are without the compaſs of all the Promiſes made to believing and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners? Far be it from you to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſuch black Thoughts concerning your Condition. If you had upon you the Guilt of all the Sins that ever have been committed ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to this day, yet if you could ſincerely repent of them all, caſt them all off, and truly believe in Chriſt, you might be ſure of the pardon of them: for ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and unlimited, of ſo large a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and extent are the Promiſes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which are made to all believing and penitent Sinners, that they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them all, and take them in. This is ſo clear and evident, that no Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be made againſt it, unleſs by one that will be ſatisfied with nothing that can be laid before him, or offered him for his Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>But I have run on ſo long impenitently, and rejected ſo many Offers
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:61506:207"/>of Mercy, that I fear there is no Mercy, there can be none for me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> (1.) Doth not God call and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite ſuch as well as others? Are not his gracious Calls and Invitations to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance general? Are they any where reſtrained, or clogged with any Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? Are they any where narrowed and ſtraitned with the exception of any ſorts of Sinners whatſoever?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) How many of thoſe in the Old Teſtament and in the New, that had long gone on in a ſinful Courſe impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, obtained Mercy at length, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the long-continued Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in their evil Ways?</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Do not the Promiſes of Mercy to be obtained by penitent and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sinners, extend to ſuch as well as unto others? Where are they by any Scripture excluded from Mercy? And if the holy Scriptures exclude them not, why ſhould they exclude themſelves?</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Doth not our Saviour aſſure us, that all manner of Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto Men upon their Repentance?
<note place="margin">Mat. 12.31</note> (for that is ever in this matter ſuppoſed, though not expreſſed.) Now if all manner of Sin and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall upon Repentance be forgiven
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:61506:207"/>unto Men, then undoubtedly no truly humbled and ſincerely penitent Sinners ſhall be denied the Forgiveneſs of their Sins, how long ſoever and how obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſoever they have gone on in their ſinful Practices.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>But I fear I may not belong to the Election of Grace; and if ſo, then all my Endeavours to find Mercy with God would be fruitleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You ought not to neglect your known Duty, becauſe you cannot dive into God's ſecret Decrees: though you know not what God's ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Purpoſes may be concerning you, yet he hath plainly and ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed what your Duty is, and what he requires of you, in order to your Salvation. It concerns you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to trouble your Mind about God's ſecret Purpoſes concerning you, but to apply your ſelf with all holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the conſcientious Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of your Duty; and ſo doing, to caſt your ſelf upon the free Grace and Mercy of God in Chriſt: <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord our God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> 
               <hi>but things revealed belong to us, and to our Children, that we may do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="398" facs="tcp:61506:208"/>
            <p n="2">2. If you perform your Duty as you ought, God will be ſure to perform his Promiſes; you may depend and build upon it, that if you be not wanting to your Duty, he will never fail to deal with you according to his Word: <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhall paſs away,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 13.31.</note> 
               <hi>but</hi> his <hi>Word ſhall not paſs away.</hi> What God hath ſpoken, ſhall certainly take Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is the beſt Courſe, indeed the only Courſe which you can take to be ſatisfied concerning your Election. When you find in your ſelf the Work of Grace, and the Fruits of true Faith and ſincere Repentance, true Holineſs and univerſal Obedience, a ſtudious and holy Care, and endeavour to pleaſe God in all things, and to decline and avoid whatſoever is diſpleaſing unto him; when you find theſe things in your ſelf, you may thence certainly and infallibly conclude, that you are one of thoſe who belong to the Election of Grace: for theſe things wrought in the Heart, are Fruits and Effects of God's electing Grace, and can be found in none but ſuch as are his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, his Elect, <hi>ordained to eternal Life,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:61506:208"/>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. So then the Graces of the Spirit, and that holy Change which is wrought in the Hearts of all ſound and ſincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, are Evidences of their eternal Election, as may be gathered from the Scriptures laſt mentioned; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that ſhall lay aſide and neglect his known Duty, and reſolve to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards his Salvation until he knows his own Election, muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably periſh, becauſe his Election cannot be known, but by the Fruits and Effects thereof, appearing in the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mens Lives and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. How many thouſands, perhaps Millions, of glorified Saints may there be in Heaven, who never made this Scruple, or at leaſt never ſuffered it ſo far to prevail with them, as to hinder and withhold them from giving all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make their Calling and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſure, by an earneſt Endeavour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Faith, Repentance, Holineſs, and all other Graces accompanying Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <pb n="400" facs="tcp:61506:209"/>
            <p>And ſo I come to the 6th and laſt thing in the Words, namely, What <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi> gained, or what he learned by all this: <hi>Then</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>knew that the Lord he was God.</hi> We may not think that <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was wholly ignorant of God before; ſome kind of Knowledg of God he had, but he had no ſuch expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental and effectual Knowledg of God, as by theſe God's Dealings with him he attained. That Knowledg of God which neither works upon the Heart, nor reforms the Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, is little better than perfect Ignorance of God. It is ſaid of the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.12.</note> that they were <hi>Sons of</hi> Belial, <hi>and knew not the Lord:</hi> They knew not the Lord to any purpoſe; they knew him not in ſuch a manner as they ought to have known him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this was <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh</hi>'s Caſe; while he went on in his ſinful Courſes, and would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, he knew not the Lord. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Knowledg of God he might have, it ſignified nothing in God's Account. But <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> by thoſe ſore Afflictions which God brought upon him, gained an experimental Knowledg of God's
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:61506:209"/>Power to ſubdue and humble the moſt ſtout and obſtinate Sinners, of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Holineſs in puniſhing Sin, of the Truth of his Threatnings and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of Judgments againſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; of his gracious and merciful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to pardon Sin, and to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the greateſt Sinners upon their ſound Humiliation and ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; of God's abſolute Dominion and uncontrolable Soveraignty over the higheſt among Men, pulling them down, laying them low, and raiſing them up again, as it ſeems good in his Eyes. The experimental Knowledg of all theſe things in God, and relating to him, did <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> gain by that ſevere Courſe which God took with him, for bringing him home to himſelf, when gentler Means would not prevail. All this may be implied in thoſe Words, <hi>Then</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>knew that the Lord he was God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to apply this very briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. This ſhould reconcile us to Afflictions, and make us willing to come under that ſevere Courſe of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:61506:210"/>which is ſo beneficial to us, and by which we gain ſo much.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. It ſhould alſo teach us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Afflictions, ſo as we may profit by them, and to obſerve what we gain by our Sufferings; for Gainers we ſhall be, if we be not wanting to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>This is apparently God's End in bringing them upon us, who as a wiſe and careful Inſpecter, and a gracious Father, orders all things to our Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And it becomes us to obſerve the ſame Method, and accordingly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what he ſo graciouſly intends for our Good; to be humble and patient to ſubmit to his fatherly Chaſtiſements, and to repent of thoſe Sins he chaſtiſes us for.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore doth a living Man complain, a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sins?</p>
                  <p>Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE main Scope of theſe Words is to direct us how we ſhould carry our ſelves in time of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. The Direction which is here given us, conſiſts of two Parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are informed what we muſt not do; we muſt not complain: 'tis moſt unreaſonable and unlawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, whatever our Afflictions be. So much is at leaſt implied in that interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory Form of Speech, <hi>Wherefore doth a living Man complain, a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sins?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="404" facs="tcp:61506:211"/>
            <p n="2">2. We are taught what is to be done, and what Courſe we ought to take when we are afflicted; We muſt <hi>ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.</hi> So then the former part of the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is negative, the latter affirmative.</p>
            <p>As to the former of theſe, ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend there is a ſpecial Emphaſis in thoſe Words, <hi>Wherefore doth a living Man complain?</hi> But all do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and explain that Emphaſis in the ſame manner. <hi>Wherefore doth a living Man complain?</hi> that is, as ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, why doth any Man living com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of his Troubles and Afflictions, ſeeing 'tis the common Lot and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Men while they live here, to be ſubject to Afflictions, Man being <hi>born unto Trouble,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 5.7.</note> 
               <hi>as the Sparks fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſets forth the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Condition of Man in this World? Why ſhould any Man living complain of that which befals all others as well as himſelf, and which none may ever hope to be exempted from as long as they live upon this Earth? Others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Emphaſis thus; <hi>Why doth a living Man complain,</hi> ſay they; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as while he is alive, whatever his Sufferings be, he is mercifully and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:61506:211"/>dealt with? If he were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Deſert of his Sins, he ſhould no longer be a living Man; he ſhould be cut off from the Land of the Living, and caſt into Hell. Either of theſe Senſes is agreeable enough to the Analogy of Faith; but of the two the latter beſt ſutes with the principal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of this Place, and with what follows in the latter Clauſe of the Verſe; <hi>Why doth a living Man complain, a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sins?</hi> So long as there is no Evil that in this World befals a Man, but what hath Relation to Sin, and muſt be looked upon as a juſt Puniſhment thereof; what reaſon hath any Man living to complain, as if he were hardly dealt with? But then to the end we may not miſtake the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Words, we muſt conſider what kind of Complaint is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. In our Afflictions ſome ſorts of complaining are allowed us; yea ſome Complaining is ſo far from being unlawful, that 'tis our Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is lawful to expreſs what we feel and ſuffer in thoſe ways which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf (I ſpeak not now of ſinful and depraved Nature) prompts unto us. So Groanings and Sighings, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:61506:212"/>louder Outcries, ſometimes in Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of tormenting Pain, are but as it were the Voice of Nature thus making Diſcovery of its Preſſures, and as it were endeavouring to eaſe it ſelf. And no doubt but there is ſome little Relief in that kind of Complaint: for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would be more oppreſs'd if it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtifled and ſuppreſs'd its Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to give Vent to its Anguiſh by complaining. And moreover, the Strength of Nature would be ſooner waſted and ſpent, if ſo much of it muſt be always exerted and put forth to the utmoſt to keep in and impriſon its Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. We ſee God hath furniſhed unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable living Creatures, at leaſt many of them, with ſome kind of natural Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage whereby the Creature is able to complain when it ſuffers. And as for Man, what is purely natural to him, cannot be any part of his Sin: for the Creator ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver infuſed Sin or any Principle of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Depravation and Irregularity into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Creatures. What I have now ſaid, may be of uſe to ſome who in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Anguiſh and bodily Pain are troubled at thoſe Complaints which they cannot but give way to, and are apt to charge them on themſelves as
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:61506:212"/>their Sin. There may be Complaints, and ſuch as have a ſpecial Accent upon them; there may be loud Cries, and yet no Sin in all this. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his roaring, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. and ſo again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3. But though he roared all the day long, as in the Place laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, yet we cannot thence neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily infer that he was impatient. He was a holy and a patient Man, who being often enforced to cry out through the Sharpneſs of his exquiſite Pain, ſaid, <hi>Though I roar, yet I do not murmur.</hi> You may cry out, and it may be roar alſo, from the Anguiſh of your Pain, and yet it's poſſible there may not be the leaſt ſinful Diſcompoſure of your Spirit, or riſing of your Heart againſt God ſo lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Hand upon you.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We may lawfully and freely complain to thoſe that are about us, to our Friends, Relations and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; we may lay open our Griefs, and repreſent our Sufferings to the full, with all the Circumſtances of them, when and where there is juſt Occaſion. And this may be very neceſſary and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, both in reference to them and our ſelves: For beſides the preſent eaſing of our Hearts by this Diſcovery of our
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:61506:213"/>Troubles, we hereby make them ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our Condition, and kindle in them thoſe Compaſſions towards us, which our preſent Condition calls for: we ſtir them up to Prayer for us, and give them occaſion of exerciſing all thoſe Graces which the Afflictions of others call forth and imploy. But here we muſt take heed that in our Complaints we make not our Afflictions greater than they are; that we aggravate them not beyond the juſt Meaſures and true Weight of them; a thing too ordinary with the Afflicted, eſpecially in ſome Caſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We may in our Afflictions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to God alſo as well as to Men. 'Tis our Duty to ſpread our Condition before him, imploring that Relief from him, which his Hand alone is able to reach forth unto us. Not as if he were ignorant of our Eſtate or Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but he would have us ſo to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that we are ſenſible of his Hand upon us, and that we have no Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Relief from any elſe but him.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. The Servants of God have not only a Liberty of making their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to God in their Afflictions, but alſo of humbly expoſtulating with him
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:61506:213"/>about them, provided that it be done in a due manner, and ſo as the Diſtance between God and his Creature be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. We have frequent Examples hereof in Scripture. Sometimes holy Men expoſtulate with God concerning the Grievouſneſs and Severity of their Afflictions: Sometimes concerning the Length and Duration of them; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concerning the Inſtruments which God makes uſe of to correct them; ſometimes concerning his ſeeming to caſt off all Care of them in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, neither minding their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor regarding their Prayers: <hi>Is my Strength the Strength of Stones, and is my Fleſh of Braſs?</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 6.12. <hi>Why hast thou ſet me as a Mark againſt thee, ſo that I am a Burden to my ſelf?</hi> Job 7.20. <hi>How long wilt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get me, O Lord, for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy Face from me?</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 13.1. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, how long wilt thou be angry againſt the Prayer of thy People?</hi> Pſal. 80.4. <hi>Where is thy Zeal and thy Strength, the Sounding of thy Bowels, and of thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards me? Are they reſtrained?</hi> So expoſtulated the Church with God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15. <hi>Wherefore doth the way of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:61506:214"/>the VVicked proſper? and wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherouſly?</hi> ſaid the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 12.1. But though the Servants of God take the Boldneſs thus to expoſtulate with God, yet they do not charge him fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or lay any Imputation of Unjuſtice or inequitable Rigour on his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, unleſs when they are under ſome preſent Diſtemper, as ſometimes it may ſeem to have been with <hi>Job</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> They evermore, when in their proper and right Frame, aſcribe Righteouſneſs to their Maker, and the meritorious Cauſe of all their Sufferings to themſelves. And ſo in thoſe darker Providences in which they could not diſcern the Reaſons of God's Diſpenſations, or the Equity of his Proceedings, yet they ſtill adhered to this as a Principle not to be queſtioned, that God was Righteous. This the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when about to expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with God, addreſſeth himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with this Preface, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee; yet let me talk with thee of thy Judgments:</hi> And then he goes on with the Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation before-mentioned; <hi>VVherefore doth the way of the VVicked proſper? and
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:61506:214"/>wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherouſly?</hi> So the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> alſo makes the like Preface to his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation;
<note place="margin">Hab. 1.13.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>than to behold Evil, and canſt not look upon Iniquity: Wherefore lookeſt thou on them that deal treacherouſly, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy Tongue when the VVicked devoureth the Man that is more righteous than he?</hi> And the ſame holy Frame of Spirit ſhould there be in us: Though we may in ſome Caſes take the Liberty of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reverent Expoſtulation with God, yet we muſt take heed of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet Reflections upon his Juſtice or Goodneſs, and ſtill remember our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him, that <hi>God is in Heaven, and we are upon Earth,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.2. And that <hi>he giveth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any of his Matters,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently repreſents him to <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 33.13.</p>
            <p>So then all theſe ſorts of Complaints being allowed us, the Complaint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Text, is that which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceeds from, or is joined with Impatience under God's Hand, and Diſcontent with his Providence; 'tis the Complaint of an unquiet and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſturbed Spirit, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:61506:215"/>ſometimes expreſſeth by murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſo here the Word in the Original may properly enough be tranſlated, and ſo the ſame Word is rendred, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.1. Now the Evil and Unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this kind of Complaint under the Hand of God, may appear ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis long before God takes the Rod in Hand to correct: he bears long even with the vileſt of Sinners, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth much Patience towards them; <hi>He is ſlow to Anger, and of great Mercy,</hi> Pſal. 145.8. <hi>He is merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, long-ſuffering, and abundant in Goodneſs,</hi> Exod. 34.6. He takes no Delight in Severity, further than we provoke him thereunto: <hi>He doth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men,</hi> Lam. 3.33. And ſhould no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this Conſideration be of Force to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all our diſcontented Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Murmurings, that God is ſo unwilling to uſe Severity againſt us; that he is ſo hardly drawn on to chaſter us, and that he never doth it till we have given him much Cauſe ſo to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we by our many Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have put the Rod into his Hand,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:61506:215"/>he is ſoon prevailed with to lay it aſide again: He is not of that implacable Temper, that he can never be reconciled to thoſe againſt whom he hath once taken up any Diſpleaſure. Upon our humble Submiſſion to his Corrections, and ſincere Reſolutions and Endeavours to reform what hath been amiſs, he is graciouſly inclined to lay aſide his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: <hi>He is ready to forgive:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 86.5.</note> moſt ready to ſhew Mercy as ſoon as we are in any meaſure fit for Mercy. He doth not always chide,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 103.9</note> nor <hi>keep his Anger for ever.</hi> Was this only <hi>David</hi>'s particular Experience? and is it not ours alſo? Do not we find how eaſy he is to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and how ready to pardon? Have we not had manifold Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof in the Courſe of our Lives? And ſhould not this perſwade us quietly and patiently to ſubmit to his Corrections, while he is pleaſed to keep us under his chaſtning Hand?</p>
            <p n="3">3. While he judgeth it fit to correct us, he lays no more upon us than our Sins deſerve. When we are moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely handled, and are apt to complain we have hard meaſure, yet even then do not his Severities in the leaſt exceed the Demerits of our Sins: God doth us
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:61506:216"/>no wrong; nor is it poſſible that he ſhould, for his Will is the Rule and Meaſure of Righteouſneſs: <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his VVorks,</hi> Pſal. 145.17. <hi>The juſt Lord will not do Iniquity,</hi> Zeph. 3.5. What Cauſe then is there, or can there be of complaining where no Wrong is done? With this the Church of God ſilenceth her ſelf, and ſtops her own Mouth when under the moſt dreadful Effects of God's Diſpleaſure:
<note place="margin">Lam. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is righteous,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>for I have rebelled againſt his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> And with this God ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the Mouth of his People; <hi>VVhy crieſt thou for thine Afflictions?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 30.15.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe thy Sins were increaſed, have I done theſe things unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. When God afflicts moſt grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his Severities are far ſhort of what our Sins deſerve. Under the heavieſt Weight of Puniſhment <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment in the Name of the Church muſt be ours;
<note place="margin">Ezra 9.13.</note> 
               <hi>VVe are puniſhed leſs than our Iniquities deſerve.</hi> Our Sins deſerve not only all the temporal Plagues and Judgments which we are capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing, but Hell, the unutterable and endleſs Torments of the Lake, that burns with Fire and Brimſtone. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:61506:216"/>whatever our Sufferings be in this World, ſo long as we are on this ſide Hell, ſo little Cauſe have we to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that we have great Cauſe to be thankful that it is not far worſe with us than it is.</p>
            <p n="5">5. How much ſoever God is pleaſed to afflict us, yet ſtill we enjoy many Mercies in the mean time, by which the Bitterneſs of our Afflictions is much allayed, and the Smart of them much abated. For one or two Croſſes we are compaſſed about with Variety of Bleſſings: In Sickneſs we have the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Compaſſion of Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; we have all that Service and Aſſiſtance that many Hands about us can afford us; we have all thoſe Means of Relief that either Love or Art can ſupply us with: And all this, beſides thoſe inward and powerful Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which we have more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God. Again, if it ſo be that God afflicts us in one of our Relations, we have Matter of Comfort in divers others of them. If we have Loſſes in our temporal Eſtate, yet our ſpiritual and better Concernments are ſafe and untouched. If Man be at Variance with us, yet we have Peace with God.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:61506:217"/>How ſadly ſoever we may in our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions repreſent things to our ſelves, God never ſtirs up all his Wrath againſt us at once, nor ſuffers his whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to ariſe. God never ſo mingles the Cup which he puts into our Hands, but that there are ſome Ingredients of a benign and friendly Nature to qualify the Malignity of the reſt. The Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity did I ſay? There is indeed no real Malignity in any of the Ingredients of that ſpiritual Phyſick which God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters to his. All things have a kind and beneficial Influence for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting our Good, and furthering our higheſt Intereſt. And where now is there any Place left for complaining? Amidſt ſo many Mercies, can we yet find in our Hearts to complain? Be it ſo, that ſome things are not only unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, but very grievous to us; <hi>Shall we receive Good at the Hands of God, and ſhall we not receive Evil?</hi> Shall we bear nothing at the Hands of him who is ſo good and gracious, ſo kind and bountiful to us many other ways? Let us not ſuffer two or three Afflictions ſo to imbitter our Spirits, and vitiate our Palats, as that we ſhould not reliſh the Sweetneſs of any of thoſe Mercies,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:61506:217"/>which in our moſt afflicted Condition we ſtill enjoy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Add to all this, that God hath a Sovereignty of Power and Dominion over his Creatures, by virtue whereof he may deal with them as he pleaſeth. According to this his abſolute Power, though the Creature had never ſinned, yet God might expoſe it to ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries as exceed not the Benefit of that Being he has given it. He that made the Creature out of nothing, as he might turn it into nothing again if he pleaſed; ſo continuing it in being, he might lay any ſuch Pain or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh upon it without relation to Sin. We ſee what Anguiſh the unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures endure, which yet are not capable of Sin: And why might not God inflict the like on any rational Creature, though no Sin had occaſioned it, or made way for it? It is not eaſy to give a Reaſon why he might not: for even an innocent Creature, being a Creature however, muſt of neceſſity be in Subjection to the Power and Dominion of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, from whom it received its Being. 'Tis true, ſuch Evils could not then have the Nature of Puniſhment, becauſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:61506:218"/>properly ſo called, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Sin; but yet there could be no Injuſtice in ſuch a Diſpenſation, no more than when by many tormenting and lingring Pains God takes away the Lives of brute Beaſts, whoſe Nature is not a Subject capable of Sin or moral Evil.</p>
            <p>Now in ſuch a Caſe the Creature would have no juſt Cauſe to complain or murmur, becauſe no Injury could poſſibly be done it by God's uſing that juſt and rightful Power and Dominion which he hath over the Work of his Hands. Whence we may thus argue to our preſent Purpoſe: If God's abſolute Power over the Work of his Hands be ſuch as calls for humble Submiſſion to his Providence, and ſilent bearing of whatever he inflicts; how much more ſhould his Juſtice ſtrike us dumb, and effectually reſtrain us from all murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or muttering againſt him? If we ought not to complain or murmur though we had no Sin, how much leſs reaſon have we to do it when we have ſo much? Upon this Conſideration it was that the Church took up her Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of patient Submiſſion to the Hand of God;
<note place="margin">Micah 7.9.</note> 
               <hi>I will bear the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:61506:218"/>of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to apply what hath been ſpoken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Let us in all our Afflictions obſerve the Frame of our Hearts, and be humbled for all the ſecret Grudgings and Riſings of our Spirits againſt the Providence of God: And eſpecially if the inward Diſtempers of our Souls ſhould be at any time ſo great as to break forth and vent themſelves in any unmeet Language; if our inward Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and Heart-burnings ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves by complaining and murmuring againſt God, and by making ſuch Repreſentations of him to others, as if he had dealt hardly with us, and as if we might have expected other meaſure at his Hands.</p>
            <p>This is a Miſcarriage which we are very apt to run into when our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſevere and laſting, when they ſmart much and continue long. But however it fare with us, the Sinfulneſs of our murmuring againſt God is ſo great, that no Circumſtance of our Sufferings can render it excuſable; and therefore we cannot be ſufficiently humbled for it.</p>
            <pb n="420" facs="tcp:61506:219"/>
            <p>To the end we may the better diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Evil of it, and ſee what reaſon there is why we ſhould be humbled for it, let us firſt look upon it in its Cauſe, and the Root whence it ſprings; then let us behold it as it is in it ſelf, and conſider it in its formal Nature: And laſtly let us view it in its Effects and Conſequents.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us look upon it in its Root. We loath and abhor ſome things the more when we know whence they are, and what gave Birth to them; the wicked Offspring for the curſed Mother that bare it and brought it forth.</p>
            <p>Now the Root of our murmuring is our Pride; we have entertained too good an Opinion of our ſelves; we think we have deſerved better things at the Hands of God, and therefore we murmur and complain as if we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. Were we throughly ſenſible of our Sinfulneſs; were we convinced that we are worthy of far ſorer Evils than thoſe which we groan under, inſtead of murmuring, we would not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Puniſhment of our Sins, as the Phraſe is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.41. take in good part, meekly and patiently bear whatſoever God lays on us, but from
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:61506:219"/>our Hearts acknowledg that we are mercifully and kindly dealt with in that no more is inflicted on us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we behold it as it is in it ſelf, and conſider the formal Nature of it, our murmuring is in effect nothing elſe but a Degree of Inſurrection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God. As diſcontented Subjects, or mutinous Souldiers ſharpen their Tongues againſt their Prince or General, and thereby heighten their own and other Mens Diſcontents, to diſpoſe them to make Reſiſtance: So when we murmur againſt God, we ſet our Mouths againſt Heaven, doing what in us lies to ſtrengthen in our ſelves, and inſtil into others Principles of Diſaffection againſt the higheſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and to withdraw them with whom we converſe from their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Loyalty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us view it in the Effects and Conſequents of it. We are ſo far from eaſing our ſelves by murmuring, that it both increaſeth and prolongeth our Afflictions.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It increaſeth them; for our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs and Stubborneſs under God's Hand provokes him to lay more Load upon us; that is all we gain by our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardneſs;
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:61506:220"/>as the Child that ſtruggles, ſwells and murmurs when he is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, doth but thereby procure to himſelf the more Stripes.</p>
            <p>Beſides, our fretting and murmuring doth of it ſelf make thoſe our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons much more grievous, which might be undergone with Eaſe, if with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Silence and Patience we ſubmitted our ſelves to the Chaſtiſement of our heavenly Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It alſo prolongs our Afflictions; for our murmuring diverts us, and takes us off from applying our ſelves to that Courſe, which, if any thing, would put a ſpeedy End to our Troubles. And that is the Courſe which we are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Text, namely, a ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon our ſelves, and a diligent Search and Enquiry after the Sins which have procured our Afflictions, and a turning from them unto God whom we have forſaken.</p>
            <p>As long as we are taken up in mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, this Work is not minded, and ſo our Afflictions are protracted and drawn out to a greater length than they ſhould have been, if in ſtead of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt God we had ſeaſonably and narrowly ſearched into our Hearts
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:61506:220"/>and Ways, found out our Sins, judged our ſelves for them, and forſaken them.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee what Reaſon we have to be humbled for this Sin.</p>
            <p>But though in theſe Reſpects all that are guilty of it have Cauſe to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; yet have they moſt reaſon to be humbled for murmuring, who have leaſt reaſon to murmur: ſuch as are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Great and notorious Sinners, whoſe Offences and Enormities have been ſuch, that whatſoever they ſuffer, unleſs they be wilfully blind, or ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partial to themſelves, they muſt be inforced to confeſs that they ſuffer juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Should they complain of hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, who are ſo bad that no Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſevere enough for them? And yet theſe are oft-times as ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as any elſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe who have drawn ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions upon themſelves, as in which they may plainly read their Sin written in legible Characters. The unclean Perſon who hath by his lewd Courſes brought thoſe Evils upon himſelf, which are the proper Effects and Puniſhments of that Sin: The great Oppreſſor of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that is through God's righteous Judgment fallen into the mercileſs
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:61506:221"/>Hands of Oppreſſors himſelf: The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, that having raiſed an Eſtate by Rapine and Violence, hath lived to ſee the Extortioner catch all that he hath: The falſe Accuſer, who having by Lies and Slanders robbed others of their good Name and Eſtates, is now fallen under the Laſh of thoſe falſe Tongues that ſpare him no more than he hath ſpared others. Have any of theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to murmur againſt God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? Should not their own Guilt ſtifle their Complaints, and ſtop their Mouths? Or, if they will open them, ſhould it not be to give Glory to God's Juſtice, by whoſe over-ruling and moſt righteous Providence it hath come to paſs, that they ſuffer either in the ſame kind in which they have offended, or in that which correſponds, and bears a viſible Proportion with it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. When Men ſuffer that which they have often been forewarned of; when they have met with many Caveats and Cautions; when it hath been often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told them what the certain Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents and unavoidable Iſſues of ſuch Courſes would be, and yet they would preſumptuouſly go on, and ruſh into Danger, as the Horſe ruſheth into the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:61506:221"/>Battel. Have theſe Men Reaſon to complain of any but themſelves? If Men will run into the Briars, and none can withhold them, have they any cauſe to complain that they are ſcratch'd and torn? And yet even in ſuch Caſes as this, the Circumſtances whereof a Man would think are ſuch as leave a Man no colour of complaining; yet will Men find out Matter of Complaint even againſt God himſelf, their Hearts riſing againſt his Providence, that he ſhould thus leave them to themſelves, and ſuffer them to go on ſo wilfully and ſool-hardily upon Danger. As if God were bound to cure all Man's Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to ſubdue his Obſtinacy; and as if it were God's Fault that Man will not hearken to good Counſel.</p>
            <p>If obſtinate and refractory Sinners will run upon their own Ruine not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all Warnings, they muſt know their Deſtruction is of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they have none to thank for it but themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the Evils under which Men lie, are the direct and proper Iſſues and Products of their own impatient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and moſt importunate Prayers: when Men beg things of God, and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:61506:222"/>purſue them with reſtleſs Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and will take no Denial whether the things be good for them or no; if having obtained them, they reliſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gall and Wormwood in them, inſtead of the Content and Satisfaction they promiſed themſelves; where can they juſtly lay the Blame but on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Have they any Plea to juſtify their murmuring againſt God, who indeed gave them their Deſires in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and gratified them to their Smart, becauſe nothing elſe would ſatisfy them? They would be their own Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and take upon themſelves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what was good for them better than God. If <hi>Rachel</hi>'s longing for Children be ſo impatient that ſhe muſt have them or ſhe will die, if God give her a Child that ſhall coſt her her Life, what reaſon hath ſhe to complain of any but her ſelf, and the impetuous Irregularity of her own Deſires, that ſhe purchaſed it at ſo dear a rate? If the Iſraelites muſt have Quails, and no other Food will pleaſe their inordinate Palat; if they eat till they ſurfeit of them, till they come out of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and the next News be that the Plague is among them, ſhall they yet
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:61506:222"/>charge God fooliſhly, and lay the Blame upon him? If the boundleſs Deſires of the ambitious Man aſpire to a Crown, and nothing elſe will ſatisfy him: when he hath gotten it, if he find it lined with Thorns, can he murmur at Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that hath ſet it on his Head?</p>
            <p>If murmuring be any where unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and unjuſt, then certainly 'tis when Men ſuffer in thoſe very things which were the Objects of their moſt paſſionate Deſires and unwearied Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. But yet,</p>
            <p n="5">5. After all that hath been ſaid, they have leaſt Reaſon to complain, and of all others have leaſt to juſtify their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, who have the beſt and moſt effectual Arguments to quiet their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits under every Providence, and to keep down all the inordinate Workings of their Hearts. And ſuch are all they who having obtained the Pardon of their Sins, have an Intereſt in God's ſpecial Love and Favour through Chriſt. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. They may know that whatever befals them, Sin being pardoned, the Curſe and Sting of every Affliction is taken out: Though their Afflictions may be bitter and grievous to Nature,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:61506:223"/>yet there is no Poiſon in them, nothing of a hurtful or deſtructive Nature: Chriſt hath removed the Curſe,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.13.</note> being made a Curſe for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. They may know that all their Sufferings are intended for their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, not for their Prejudice, and ſhall undoubtedly be advantagious to them in the End, however for the preſent they may not ſo clearly diſcern God's particular Deſign and Intendment in them.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> God hath aſſured them, that <hi>all things work together for Good to them that love God, to thoſe that are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. They are ſure to be ſupported under all their Preſſures. They may ſometimes be hardly put to it, but yet they ſhall never want Supplies of Strength proportionable to their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. God will mercifully conſider their Weakneſs, and lay no more upon them than he will enable them to bear. He is faithful,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> and will not ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are able.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. They are ſure to be eaſed of their Afflictions in God's due time: <hi>The Rod of the Wicked ſhall not reſt upon the Lot of the Righteous;</hi> it ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways reſt there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. <hi>Many
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:61506:223"/>are the Afflictions of the Righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of them all,</hi> Pſal. 34.19.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Tho their Afflictions ſhould run parallel with their Lives, and have no other End than by Death, yet the endleſs and unſpeakable Happineſs of the World to come will be an abundant Compenſation for all their Afflictions here,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> 
               <hi>The Sufferings of this preſent time being not worthy to be compared with the Glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, I ſay, if ſuch as have theſe excellent and ſovereign Cordials, theſe ſolid Grounds of Conſolation, theſe efficacious Means of quieting their Hearts, and ſuppreſſing all their ſinful Diſtempers, ſhould yet murmur under the Hand of God, their Murmuring of all others would be moſt inexcuſable. If ſuch ſhould murmur, what might be expected from them who have none of theſe things to charm and compoſe their Spirits? Well might they <hi>gnaw their Tongues, and blaſpheme the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for Anguiſh, becauſe of their Pains;</hi> as the Carriage of ſome of the Wicked in their Afflictions is deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.10, 11.</p>
            <pb n="430" facs="tcp:61506:224"/>
            <p>But let not us by our unquiet and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Demeanure under the Hand of God, diſhonour our Profeſſion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage thoſe excellent Grounds of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and Calmneſs of Spirit under every Diſpenſation of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which our Religion ſupplies and furniſheth us with.

               </hi>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:61506:224"/>19.3. and the tumultuous Fermentings of our Spirits againſt his Providence, would hurry us into.</p>
            <p>In the further Proſecution of this Uſe, I ſhall firſt propound a few things for the quieting of our Hearts in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and then I ſhall anſwer ſome of thoſe Pleas or Objections which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken and unruly Spirits, not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſubdued to God, make uſe of to juſtify their Exceſſes.</p>
            <p>In order to the quieting of our Hearts amidſt all our Trials, and to the taming of our rebellious Spirits,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us get our Hearts fully poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the abſolute Sovereignty and Dominion which God hath over us. Such is his Power over us, that we and all the Nations of the World are in his Hands but as the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, as God makes the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.6. He may form us and faſhion us, do with us and diſpoſe of us as he ſees good: Neither need he render any other Reaſon or Account of what he doth, than that of his own good Pleaſure. Now as the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20, 21. <hi>Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:61506:225"/>Potter Power over the Clay, to make one Veſſel unto Honour, and another unto Diſhonour;</hi> one for a baſer Uſe, another for a more honourable Service? Let this reſt and abide upon your Heart, that God hath this Power over you; and you will judg it no leſs unreaſonable and intolerably ſaucy, that you ſhould murmur or conteſt with God about his Dealings with you, than that the Clay ſhould riſe up and conteſt with the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Keep alive in your Heart a Senſe of God's Love in every Diſpenſation. Black Thoughts of God, and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting him to our ſelves as our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and every of his Chaſtiſements as Fruits of his Hatred, cannot but leaven our Hearts with ſuch a ſullen Moroſity and Sowrneſs, as will make us ſeek all Opportunities of quarrelling with him. We take nothing well at the Hands of him whom we take to be our Enemy, becauſe we look upon all his Actions through the Glaſs of that Image which we have framed of him in our Minds. So while we look upon God as our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, 'tis not to be wondred at that we ſhould be ready to pick Matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining againſt him, and conteſting
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:61506:225"/>with him, out of all the Paſſages of his Providence.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, good Thoughts of God, and a lively Senſe of his Love upon our Hearts, would make whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth to look of another Colour. Viewing his Providences through theſe Spectacles, we ſhould read his Kindneſs in whatſoever he doth to us or about us; and we ſhould be inclined to make the beſt Conſtruction of every thing that ſeems to be of a doubtful Aſpect. And how powerfully would this ſubdue our Spirits, ſweeten our Affections, and make us willing to bear with Silence and Quietneſs thoſe things which to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother would be intolerable?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Labour to have always a freſh Remembrance of your Sins. To this purpoſe it might be of good Uſe to us, to ſingle out ſome of our chief Sins, by which we have moſt diſhonoured God, and wounded our Conſciences, and to have them always in a Readineſs by us, that they may preſently occur to our Thoughts, when at any time our Hearts begin to riſe againſt God in reſpect of any of his Dealings.</p>
            <p>This would furniſh us with Matter of Arguments to reaſon down the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:61506:226"/>Inſurrections of our Spirits, as ſoon as ever they begin to take Diſtaſte at any thing that God hath done. Should ſuch as we, ſo vile, ſo ſinful, ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as in ſuch and ſuch Inſtances of our Provocations we have appeared to be, take pet at any thing that God doth? Have we done as bad things as we could againſt him, and is it for us to be complaining of any thing that he doth?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Add to all this the Conſideration of the extream Danger of quarrelling with God, and oppoſing our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Dare we provoke the Lord? <hi>Are we ſtronger than he?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.22.</note> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Dare we challenge him into the Feild, and run upon the thick Boſſes of his Buckler? Let us <hi>remember the Battel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 41.8.</note> 
               <hi>and do no more,</hi> as God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Job</hi> in the like Caſe. <hi>Wo unto him that ſtriveth with his Maker:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 45.9.</note> 
               <hi>let the Potſherd ſtrive with Potſherds of the Earth.</hi> Let not us frail Creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with God who can daſh us in pieces; yea turn us into nothing in a Moment.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to ſpeak to thoſe Pleas whereby ſome endeavour to juſtify their complaining.</p>
            <pb n="435" facs="tcp:61506:226"/>
            <p>Object. 1. <hi>My Afflictions,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>are ſuch as never any Man was exerciſed with the like, all things conſidered: I could, I hope, with ſome Degree of Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and Silence bear any other Croſſes; but here I muſt be allowed to give way to ſome Diſtemper when my Croſs is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whereas you ſay, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man was afflicted as you are, you ſpeak raſhly and unadviſedly. Are you ſo well acquainted with the ſeveral Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of all the Afflicted that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are, or ever were in the World, that you ſhould pronounce ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that never any was afflicted as you are? Alas! your Knowledg reacheth but a little way. How many are there within the Compaſs of a few Miles, it may be within the Limits of the ſame Town or Pariſh where you live, whoſe particular Caſes, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Circumſtances of whoſe Afflictions you are perfectly ignorant of?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How many have had the very ſame Thoughts of their Afflictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides your ſelf? 'Tis indeed every Man's Temper in great Afflictions, and under dark Providences, to ſay with the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Behold and ſee if
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:61506:227"/>there be any Sorrow like unto my Sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted me in the Day of his fierce Anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſore Afflictions we are not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of the Matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our Sufferings; no more than a ſick Man is a competent Judg of the Eſtate of his Body, when his Diſeaſe hath gotten Poſſeſſion of his Head, and diſturbed his Fancy.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas you ſay you ſhould bear any other Croſs with more Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Silence; you ſpeak as one nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquainted with your own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor with the Deceitfulneſs of your Heart.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Your Language bewrays your ſmall Acquaintance with your Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: You know not what Frailty you might diſcover if God ſhould try you ſome other way, though it ſhould be with a far lighter and more favourable Affliction. We are never throughly acquainted with our Weakneſs till we be tried. All our Strength lies in God; if he be pleaſed to ſtand by us, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſtrengthen us, we may bear, we may eaſily and comfortably bear the greateſt Affliction; if he withdraw
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:61506:227"/>the Influences of his Supports, and the Supplies of his Grace, the ſmalleſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction will worſt us.</p>
            <p>Do we not obſerve how ſtrong we are ſometimes to conflict with great Trials, and how weak other-while, when far ſmaller and leſs conſiderable. Afflictions encounter us? Who ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>h us thus to differ from our ſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God, as he either vouchſafeth us his Preſence and powerful Aſſiſtances, or withholdeth them?</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. You ſpeak as one too much a Stranger to the Deceitfulneſs of your Heart: You think you could bear any other Affliction better, and that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing could have ſo diſcompoſed you, and put you out of order; but herein your falſe and guileful Heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes you. If you were afflicted in ſome other kind, your Heart would then be as likely to tell you that you could bear any other Affliction better than that: Your preſent Affliction would ſtill be judged the moſt difficult to be born.</p>
            <p>You are like a ſick Man who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the Bed on which he lies, and thinks he ſhould be better at eaſe if he lay any where elſe: but when he makes
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:61506:228"/>trial of another Bed, he ſtill finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as reſtleſs and uneaſy as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: He now finds 'tis the Diſtemper of his Body, not the Uneaſineſs of his Bed, that makes him reſtleſs.</p>
            <p>You think you ſhould bear another Affliction better, and more like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; but as long as your Heart is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubdued to God, and the unquiet and rebellious Diſtempers of your Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and ſtick cloſe to you, it is not to be queſtioned but that you would be as unquiet, and as apt to complain and murmur under any other ſharp Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as under this. 'Tis the Change of your Heart, and not the Change of your Affliction, that muſt diſpoſe you to a patient Undergoing of your Burden.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>But,</hi> ſaith another, <hi>I ſee others as bad as my ſelf, not ſo ſeverely chaſtned: God ſeems to ſingle me out, and to ſet me up as a Mark to ſhoot at, and to direct all his Arrows against me: He makes me a Spectacle of his ſevere VVrath, and the only Inſtance of his fierce Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. VVhy ſhould I be ſo grievouſly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed while others eſcape?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You do not well underſtand your ſelf, nor remember the Diſtance between God and you. While you thus
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:61506:228"/>complain, what is this but to contend with the Almighty, and to quarrel with him as if he were your Equal or Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour? Is he to be accountable to you for his Actions? Muſt he treat you and other Men as you ſhall judg fitting? Muſt he manage the Government of the World as you would have him? And will you be angry and fall out with him if he doth not?</p>
            <p>This is not a Deportment becoming the Creature towards its Creator. An humble Acknowledgment of your Sin, and a Profeſſion of your Reſolution to reform, were more agreeable to your Condition, and the Circumſtances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which you ſtand towards God. <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done Iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> So <hi>Elihu</hi> judged, <hi>Job</hi> 34.31, 32.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are you the only Inſtance of God's Severity? Are there not many more to be ſeen, if you look abroad and caſt your Eyes up and down the World? Though God's Patience and long-Sufferance be admirable for the preſent, and though he hath thought fit to put over the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the greater part of Offences
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:61506:229"/>to the Judgment of the great Day; yet in the mean time he ſo conſults the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Juſtice here, as not to leave the World without many ſignal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his Severity againſt Sin. And if it ſeem good to him to make you one of thoſe Inſtances, what have you to object againſt it? Is he not at liberty to make uſe of what Inſtances he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? If he had thought fit to let you paſs unpuniſhed, and inſtead of you had pitched on any other, might not that other Perſon have had as good a Plea for complaining as you now think you have?</p>
            <p>It ſeems by your Exceptions againſt God's Providence, that he muſt either puniſh all Offenders here, or none. This is the Rule which you would ſet him for the Exerciſe of this Part of his Government of the World: and if he do not obſerve it, you will conteſt with him about it, and have from him an Account thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If God make choice of you to vindicate the Honour of his Juſtice and Holineſs before the World, and to take off ſome part of that Imputation, which, in the Judgment of carnal Wiſdom, from his Patience, ſeems to lie upon his
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:61506:229"/>Juſtice: if in you, as in one remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſtance, he will let the World ſee how much he hates Sin, and with what exact and ſevere Righteouſneſs he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to judg the World hereafter, ſhould you murmur at it? Should you not rather be well contented that God might have any Honour by your Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings? that you who have by your Sins ſo much diſhonoured him, ſhould be capable of ſuffering any thing whereby any ſlender Reparations might be made to his Honour? Were you not made for his Glory? and if you would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to promote it by doing, were it not better you ſhould contribute to it by ſuffering, than that you ſhould wholly loſe the End of your Creation?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider whether your complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's Severity againſt you, while he deals more favourably with many others, be not a clear Evidence that your Heart is not throughly humbled for Sin. The Apoſtle, among other Fruits and Evidences of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and godly Sorrow for Sin,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.11.</note> makes mention of <hi>Indignation</hi> and <hi>Revenge.</hi> An holy Indignation which the truly humbled Sinner, the true Penitent, hath againſt himſelf, for having ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:61506:230"/>offended God, and an holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge which he takes upon himſelf on that Account. How widely different are complaining and murmuring from that holy Frame of the penitent Sinner which the Apoſtle deſcribes? When you ſuffer your Heart to riſe, and give your Tongue liberty to murmur againſt God, you ſeem to direct the Edg of your Indignation and Revenge againſt him, rather than againſt your ſelf.</p>
            <p>A due Senſe of your Sin, and of the Diſhonour you have done to God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, would make you even out of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Indignation and Revenge againſt your ſelf, humbly and patiently to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the utmoſt of that Severity which God is pleaſed to exerciſe towards you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Remember how ill God took it from his People the Jews, that they complained the Way of the Lord was not equal; which is in effect your Complaint: Concerning this he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains and expoſtulates with them; <hi>Ye ſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.25.</note> 
               <hi>The Way of the Lord is not equal? Hear now, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Is not my VVay equal? Are not your VVays unequal?</hi> And ſo again, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. And then he adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Therefore will I judg you, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>every one according to
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:61506:230"/>his VVays, ſaith the Lord God: repent and turn your ſelves from all your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Whereas ye complain of the Inequality of my Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with you, unleſs you repent I will deſtroy you all; and then you will have little Cauſe to complain of my inequal Dealings. They who complain of the Inequality of God's dealing with them, had need take heed leſt God <hi>lay Judgment to the Line, and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Plummet,</hi> as he threatens, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.17. Leſt he lay heavier things upon them; leſt he bring ſuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on them as ſhall come up more nearly to the Meaſures, the Proportion and Demerits of their Sins. How much ſoever they have ſuffered, God may yet lay much more upon them, and yet ſtill puniſh them much leſs than their Iniquities deſerve.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whereas you complain that God deals more ſeverely with you than with many others, think with your ſelf,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. That 'tis poſſible your Sins may have been greater than the Sins of ſuch as you have in your Eye; greater in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Circumſtances and Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of them: It may be they never
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:61506:231"/>ſinned againſt ſo much Light, and ſo many clear Convictions; againſt ſuch Mercies, and ſo many Diſcoveries of God's Love; againſt ſo many Warnings and gentler Chaſtiſements; againſt ſo many ſeverer Stroaks, when milder Courſes would not prevail. Can you wonder at it that God deals more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely with you than with others, if upon Examination it ſhould be found that your Sins have been greater than theirs?</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It may be God intends you more Good than many others. By ſorer Afflictions he means to make you better, and ſo much the better as your Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been and are greater. His Chaſtnings, though ſevere, are no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of his Hatred, but Fruits of his Love, and of his Purpoſe to do your Soul much Good by them; for <hi>whom the Lord loveth he correcteth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 3.12</note> 
               <hi>even as a Father doth the Son in whom he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. What if the time for correcting ſome others be not yet come? even they who have been hitherto ſpared, or been dealt very gently with, may hereafter, if milder Remedies do no good, be as ſeverely dealt with as you
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:61506:231"/>have been. God takes his own Time, and makes uſe of his own Methods for diſciplining all his; and ſome he ſees good to handle after one manner, ſome after another, as to his Wiſdom ſeems beſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. What if ſome of thoſe, who are for the preſent ſpared, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Judgment of the laſt Day, while you are chaſtned here, that you may not be condemned with the World hereafter. God may ſpare ſome others in Anger, and correct you in Mercy; for his forbearing to puniſh is ſometimes no Fruit of his Favour, but an Effect of his higheſt Diſpleaſure, according to that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>My People would not hearken to my Voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me: So I gave them up to their own Hearts Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 3. <hi>But my Troubles are long and tedious,</hi> ſaith another; <hi>there is no End of them. I have been waiting and waiting for Deliverance, but it comes not. I ſee others in Trouble, and I ſee them come well out of it; but my Feet ſtick faſt in the Mire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, 1. That it is not your Caſe alone: Did not the People of God take up the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint?
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:61506:232"/>
               <hi>The Harveſt is paſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 8.20.</note> 
               <hi>the Summer is ended, and we are not ſaved.</hi> The time when we expected Deliverance is over, and yet we are ſtill where we were; our Afflictions are ſtill lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out. Was there not a time when <hi>Zion</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.14.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord hath forſaken me, my Lord hath forgotten me?</hi> Was there not a time when <hi>David,</hi> after he had been long praying for Deliverance, and waiting,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.3.</note> ſaid, <hi>I am weary of my crying, my Throat is dried, mine Eyes fail, while I wait for my God?</hi> Wherefore have no hard Thoughts of God, much leſs give way to murmuring againſt him, who deals no otherwiſe with you, than he often deals with many of his own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is not the Cauſe of God's reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Deliverance in your ſelf? Are not you ſtill unfit for Mercy? and is not that the true reaſon why you have it not? <hi>God delighteth in Mercy,</hi> Mich. 7.18. <hi>He waiteth to be gracious,</hi> Iſa. 30.18. How ready God is to ſhew Mercy to us, when we are ready and prepared to receive it, he hath declared in the moſt pathetical way of Expreſſion;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.13,—16.</note> 
               <hi>O that my People had hearkned unto me, and that</hi> Iſrael <hi>had walked in my VVays; I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their Enemies,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:61506:232"/>and turned my Hand against their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: The Haters of the Lord ſhould have ſubmitted themſelves unto him; but their time ſhould have endured for ever. He ſhould have fed them with the fineſt of the VVheat, and with Honey out of the Rock ſhould I have ſatisfied thee.</hi> And to the ſame Purpoſe is that, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.18. <hi>O that thou hadst hearkned to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; then had thy Peace been as a River, and thy Righteouſneſs as the VVaves of the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then we may thank our ſelves that in our Afflictions we wait ſo long for Deliverance. Our Mercies never meet with any Obſtructions in God, but in our ſelves. We by our Continuance in Sin, by our Remiſneſs and Slackneſs in the Work of ſound Humiliation and Reformation, retard and ſet back our Mercies; and then we complain and murmur, as if God were ſlack and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of his Promiſes; as if he were hardly drawn to ſhew Mercy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Deliverance out of Trouble is of God's free Grace; we cannot challenge it at his Hands. We bring our ſelves into Trouble by our Sins, and he may juſtly leave us to periſh in our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. He therefore who doth all that
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:61506:233"/>he doth for us out of free Mercy, may take his own time to do it, when he pleaſeth. Is it fit that we who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any good thing, who can demand nothing of him, ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Times and Seaſons to him; and as if we required a Debt of him, ſet him a Day when he ſhould ſhew Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?</p>
            <p n="4">4. His own Time is the beſt Time. It may ſeem long to us that we wait, and ſtill our Expectations are fruſtrated; but our long waiting ſhall turn to our greater Advantage in the end; and we ſhall then ſee, that if we had obtained our Mercies ſooner, we ſhould have had leſs Mercy in them. God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are then moſt ſweet, and yield moſt full Content and Satisfaction, when they are fully ripe, and come in their proper Seaſon. 'Tis with them as with Fruit, if it be plucked before it be ripe, it's either wholly unſavory, or much leſs acceptable. We loſe much of the Comfort of our Mercies, unleſs we can be contented to wait for them till they come to Maturity.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. <hi>Though my Afflictions be very ſharp,</hi> ſaith another, <hi>and ſuch as would try the Patience of any Man, yet I
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:61506:233"/>think I could bear them without much complaining, if the Inſtruments of my Sufferings were any other than ſuch as they are. To ſuffer by the Hands of ſuch baſe and unworthy Perſons, is a Circumſtance which I cannot think of without Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But 1. This hath oft-times been the Lot of the beſt Men. No worſe Man than <hi>David</hi> complained that <hi>he was the Song of the Drunkards,</hi> Pſal. 69.12. and that <hi>the Abjects gathered themſelves together againſt him,</hi> Pſal. 35.15. And <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, that thoſe <hi>had him in deriſion, whoſe Fathers he would have diſdained to have ſet with the Dogs of his Flock,</hi> chap. 30.1. We are not better than theſe holy Men who met with this Meaſure in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God may take what Inſtruments he pleaſeth to correct you with. Is it meet the Child ſhould chuſe the Rod with which the Father ſhould chaſten him?</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis not to be doubted but that he makes uſe of the fitteſt Inſtruments. Should the Veſſel that needs ſcouring, complain againſt him that ſcoureth it, that he uſeth ſuch filthy, rough and grating Materials, rather than ſome
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:61506:234"/>clean, near, ſmooth and gentle thing? If he ſhould make uſe of ſuch Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als as theſe, they would do no good: He knows thoſe other are fitteſt to get off the Dirt and Filth, which ſtick ſo faſt that gentle Means will not remove them. So God on purpoſe makes uſe of foul and rugged Inſtruments, as fitteſt to rub off that ſinful Corruption and Filth that cleaveth ſo faſt unto our Nature.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort; if we might be allowed to chuſe the Inſtruments by which God ſhould chaſten us, we would be ſure to chuſe thoſe from whoſe Hands we might ſmart leaſt, and who would conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do us leaſt Good. 'Tis well for us, if we can think it ſo, that when God ſees cauſe to correct us, he hath a right to chuſe his Rod.</p>
            <p>But here ſome might ſay, The Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the abject and contemptible Condition of the Perſons from whom I ſuffer, doth not ſo much trouble me, as that they are thoſe from whom I deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved better things: I have obliged them by whatever Kindneſſes I was capable of conferring on them; and when they have ſerved themſelves of me, they kick at me. 'Tis not what I ſuffer from them, but their Ingratitude that I am impatient of enduring.</p>
            <pb n="451" facs="tcp:61506:234"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Ingratitude indeed is an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sin in whomſoever 'tis found; and uſually God ſome time or other meets with the ungrateful Perſon, and pays him in his own Coin. <hi>Whoſo rewardeth Evil for Good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 17.13</note> 
               <hi>Evil ſhall not depart from his Houſe.</hi> 'Tis ſeldom ſeen but that firſt or laſt, he that hath been notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ungrateful to his Benefactors, hath the ſame Meaſure returned into his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom by thoſe who have received Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes from him.</p>
            <p>But however, ſuch odious Perſons as theſe God makes uſe of; and many times he makes them the Inſtruments of his Corrections rather than others, becauſe he ſees no other ſo fit for his Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may be ſometimes in the good Offices we do others, we look more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man than upon God; we look more after Mens due Reſentment of our Kindneſſes, and their thankful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of them, and the anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Returns they ſhould make us, than after God's Acceptance of us therein. Were our Eyes more upon God, and leſs upon Men; did we ſhew Kindneſs, and perform Offices of Love to Man in obedience to God, and ſatisfy our ſelves with his Acceptance for the preſent,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:61506:235"/>and encourage our ſelves with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of thoſe Rewards of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience which he hath promiſed hereafter, we ſhould neither be ſo often diſappointed of thoſe Returns which we expect from Men, neither ſhould we be ſo much troubled at Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that kind when we meet with them. If Men prove thankful, we ſhould take it well, and bleſs God for it; if they prove unthankful, we ſhould quiet our ſelves in God's Acceptance of what we have done, as the chief thing which we looked after.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God may ſometimes correct us by the Ingratitude of Men, that he may thereby mind us of our Ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf. Wherefore when Man's Ingratitude is ſo grievous and afflicting to us, let us reflect upon our ſelves, and think how much more diſpleaſing our Ingratitude muſt needs be unto God, who hath done a thouſand times more for us than ever we did for any Perſon living, whom we look upon as moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by us. If we therefore think we have juſt cauſe to complain of Man's Ingratitude towards us, how much greater cauſe hath God to complain of our Ingratitude towards him! in whom
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:61506:235"/>we live and move, and have our being, and from whoſe ſole Bounty we have received whatever good thing we have at any time enjoyed, or do enjoy. And yet notwithſtanding all theſe Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what hath our whole Life been but one continued Courſe of Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and an uninterrupted Series of thoſe many ill Requitals which we have made him?</p>
            <p>If we juſtify our ſelves, and ſay we cannot be juſtly charged with Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs towards God, we hereby plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover that we have never taken a juſt Account either of our Receipts from him, or of the Returns which he hath had from us.</p>
            <p>Object. 5. <hi>But I have a continual Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion and Series of Afflictions: God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth me with one Trial after another: VVhen one Affliction is but juſt over, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently another is in a readineſs to ſeize upon me. I have no ſooner obtained a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time to recover Breath, but I am again alarmed to prepare my ſelf for a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. This is that which tireth out my Patience, and makes me even weary of my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis poſſible that former Afflictions, tho many and great, have
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:61506:236"/>not ſufficiently humbled you, nor mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Sin in you. Tho ſomething may have been done upon you, yet God hath not accompliſhed his whole Work upon you; ſo that what hath been begun by former Trials, he ſees good to carry on yet further by what he ſtill further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth you with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis poſſible that by your unmeet and ſinful Carriage, and the ſtirrings and breaking forth of Corruption in your Afflictions, you may have given God juſt occaſion of bringing other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions upon you. When being under God's Hand, he expects we ſhould be humbled and reformed, then many times we diſcover more of the Pride, Stubbornneſs and Incorrigibleneſs of our Hearts, than ever we did before. Thus it was with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when God in order to his Humiliation and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation laid his Hand upon him; <hi>When I would have healed</hi> Iſrael,
<note place="margin">Hoſea 7.1.</note> 
               <hi>then the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of</hi> Ephraim <hi>was diſcovered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Though God's Corrections had for the preſent put ſome little Stop to your Sins, yet it may be afterwards you quickly returned to them again. And if we return to Sin, we need not count it ſtrange that God ſhould return to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us.</p>
            <pb n="455" facs="tcp:61506:236"/>
            <p n="4">4. Though there ſhould be no new Provocation, yet God may afflict us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for Prevention. He ſees the ſecret Frame and Diſpoſition of your Heart. If there be but a Readineſs and Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Heart to return to Sin again upon any Occaſion or Temptation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; God who ſearcheth the Heart, diſcerneth this evil Frame thereof, and judgeth it neceſſary to ſtop the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth thereof by ſome Affliction or other. To be ſure God never returns to chaſten, and renews his Witneſſes againſt us but when there is need; and therefore this we may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that whenſoever he takes the Rod again into his Hand, there is a Cauſe, whether we diſcern it or no. Wherefore if we muſt needs complain, let us complain againſt our ſelves: Let us complain of the deſperate Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Hearts, and the Stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of corrupt Nature, that calls for ſo many Blows. Let us complain of the Strength of Sin within us, that needs ſo many Afflictions to break the Power of it; and ſubdue it. Let us complain, that after we have ſuffered ſo much we ſhould ſtill be ſo bad; that ſo many Rods muſt be worn out upon
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:61506:237"/>us, and yet we are little the better.</p>
            <p>Object. 6. <hi>But my Afflictions are ſuch as I ſee not how they can ever do me any Good. If I ſaw any probable Grounds of Hope that they might prove beneficial to my Soul, and that I might be a Gainer by them in the end, then I think I could bear them more quietly. But when I can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern no Tendency that they have to my Good, how can I shuſe but complain of my hard Lot, that I ſhould be more grievouſly afflicted than many others, in ſuch ways as from which no Advantage can redound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it ſhould ſo be as you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that no Benefit could accrue to you, or was ever intended you by your Afflictions; if God ſhould lay his Hand on you merely becauſe it pleaſeth him ſo to deal with you; if he had no other end in afflicting you than only to uſe his Soveraignty and abſolute Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over you; yet in that Caſe ought you quietly to ſubmit. You are his Creature, the Work of his Hands, and he made you for himſelf.
<note place="margin">Prov. 16.4. Rev. 4.11.</note> For his <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you are and were created.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made you for himſelf, and for his own Pleaſure, have you any reaſon to complain of Wrong done you, if he
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:61506:237"/>deal with you as he pleaſeth? What are you that you ſhould think to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the common Condition of all Creatures, which is to be in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their Creator, and to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely at his Diſpoſal?</p>
            <p n="2">2. But yet this is not the Caſe; God is not wont to afflict us merely to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his Dominion over us. He chaſtens us for our Profit,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.10</note> that he may make us <hi>Partakers of his Holineſs.</hi> This we are ſure is his Deſign in his Chaſtiſements. And the Aſſurance which he hath given us hereof in the general, ſhould quiet us even when we cannot diſcover the particular end of his Corrections for the preſent, much leſs perceive wherein our Afflictions are advantageous to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas you ſay, you ſee not how you can receive any Benefit by your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; Why ſhould you make your ſelf wiſer than God? Doth not he much better underſtand what Courſe is fitteſt to do you good, than you do? Will you ſo diſparage his Wiſdom as to ſay, he takes a wrong Courſe; and that unleſs he ſhall think of dealing with you in another manner, you ſhall never be the better for his Chaſtiſements? If you grant that God is infinitely wiſe
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:61506:238"/>and good, you muſt believe that the Courſe which he takes with you is beſt, and ſhall not fail in the Iſſue to procure unto you all that Good which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended you thereby.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What if it ſhould ſo be that your Afflictions ſhould already have done you much Good, though you diſcern it not? This is a thing that often is; we are in the dark, and the Benefit which we have received, and are ſtill receiving by our Afflictions, is hid from our Eyes. Even they who moſt complain of the Fruitleſneſs of their Afflictions, yea that they are the worſe for them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the better, do many times by their very Complaints diſcover the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which by their Afflictions they have received. Their Complaints ſhew that ſince they have been afflicted, they have had a deeper Senſe of the Power and Prevalency of Sin in themſelves, and of the Hardneſs of their Hearts, and of the Obſtinacy and Rebellion of their corrupt Nature. They had never ſo clear a Sight, or ſo lively a Senſe of theſe things; neither did they ever ſo much take them to Heart, as ſince the Hand of God hath lain heavy on them. Now theſe are ſuch evident and ſignal
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:61506:238"/>Fruits and Benefits of Affliction, as ought to be acknowledged with all Thankfulneſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. So it is that oft-times it ſeems good to the moſt wiſe God for a while to conceal from us his Intentions in afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, to the end that he may thereby make us the more ſolicitous about his meaning therein, and that he may quicken us to a more diligent Enquiry and Search after the Cauſe of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; and that we may the more earneſtly and importunately ſeek unto him, and beg of him that he would be pleaſed to ſhew us why he contendeth with us, and lays his afflicting Hand on us; as alſo to help us to profit by our Afflictions. Wherefore if at any time we cannot diſcern God's End in afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, much leſs ſee that we profit by our Afflictions, this ſhould awaken us, and affect us ſo much the more; this ſhould ſtir us up to make a more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Search after thoſe Sins by which we have incurred God's Diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; it ſhould incite us to pray the more, that God would enable us to improve our Afflictions to thoſe Ends for which God lays them on us. This is the Uſe that we ſhould make of it,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:61506:239"/>when we can neither perceive that our Afflictions do us any Good, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand why God afflicts us, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conclude that we ſhall never be the better for our Afflictions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The chief Benefit to be attained by Afflictions is to be expected after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, rather than in the time of our lying under the Chaſtnings of God. So much the Apoſtle hath given us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. <hi>No chaſtning for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; nevertheleſs afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable Fruit of Righteouſneſs to them that are exerciſed thereby.</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſpiritual Phyſick: Now Phyſick we know at preſent often diſcompoſeth and diſturbs Nature, and puts the whole Body out of Frame; it makes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſick before it cures him: And ſo it is with the Phyſick of the Soul; you cannot diſcern the Benefit of it till it hath done working: It makes you ſick for the preſent, but afterwards you come to ſee it was a good Sickneſs that made way for Health, and ended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the mean time, that you ſee not that you in ſome meaſure profit by your Afflictions, and that they are by
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:61506:239"/>degrees doing you good, is very much your own Fault.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) You have a Prejudice againſt your Afflictions, you have an ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe Courſes which God takes with you for your Good; and this much hinders the kindly Operation of them upon you; as an ill Opinion of your Phyſician, or his Preſcriptions, hinders the working of your Phyſick, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives you of much of the Benefit thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) While you are under theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and perverſe Miſapprehenſions, you do not apply your ſelf to endeavour to profit by your Afflictions, improving God's Providences, and doing what in you lies to further the Succeſs of the Means which he applies and makes uſe of for the Cure of your Soul. While your Prejudices continue, and you are thereupon ſtill ſluggiſh and unactive, how can you expect to be ſenſible of the Benefit of your Afflictions? Caſt off your Prejudices, have good Thoughts of God's Methods of Cure; firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Courſe which he takes with you is the beſt and fitteſt to do you good; ariſe, and be doing what you can towards the promoting of God's
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:61506:240"/>Deſign in afflicting you; ſearch your Heart, try your Ways, endeavour to get a Sight of your Sins, a true Hatred of them, ſerious and firm Reſolutions to forſake them; renew theſe your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions often, ſtill endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ſtrengthen them more and more; and above all, be earneſt and unceſſant in Prayer to God that he would be pleaſed to bleſs your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; and then ſay if you ſee any Cauſe of complaining, that your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are ſuch as can never do you any Good.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>LAM. 3.40.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Let us ſearch and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Am now fallen upon the ſecond part of the Text, ſetting before us our Duty in time of Affliction; <hi>Let us ſearch and try our VVays, and turn again to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duty is twofold: Firſt, That <hi>we ſearch and try our VVays:</hi> And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That <hi>we turn unto the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former of theſe Duties, as 'tis firſt in the Order of the Text, ſo 'tis in Nature. We muſt ſearch after our Sins, find them out and diſcover them, and then turn away from them. 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that we ſhould forſake them, until we have a ſight of them. He who ſees not his Sins, what ſhould he elſe do but ſtill go on boldly and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly in the practice of them? What
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:61506:241"/>hath he to hinder him or reduce him? I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of both theſe Duties; and firſt of that which hath the firſt place in the Text.</p>
            <p>But before I come to ſpeak of the Duty it ſelf, of ſearching and trying our Ways in time of Affliction, in order to the finding out of thoſe our Sins, for which God hath laid his Hand upon us; I ſhall ſpeak a little in a more general way, of that which is near of kin unto the Duty of the Text; I mean, of Self-reflection, or a looking back upon our ſelves, and a reviewing and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Thoughts, Words and Ways. And that which I ſhall ſay concerning it, ſhall be touching the Excellency and great Uſefulneſs thereof, and touching the Miſchiefs of the neglect of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As touching the Excellency of Self-reflection, or reviewing of our Thoughts, Words and Actions, I need ſay no more, than that 'tis a Perfection which only Men and Angels are capable of. All other Creatures, even thoſe of them which are moſt perfect in their Kind, and ſeem to have, as it were, ſome Shadow and Reſemblance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in them; yet fall ſhort of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:61506:241"/>Perfection. They cannot review what they have done, or take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the Quality of their paſt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they cannot reckon with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and call themſelves to an account of them: And indeed they need not do it, for they are under no other Rule or Law beſide that of their Nature, and thoſe natural Inſtincts which God hath put into them; by theſe they are ruled and ſwayed, and according to theſe they act: They are under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of no moral Law, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their Actions are not capable of moral Good or Evil. But Man being under a moral Law, and accountable to his Creator for the Breaches thereof, for the better regulating and ordering of his Thoughts, Words and Actions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Preſcriptions of that Law, God hath endowed him with a Faculty of reviewing his Actions, and of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them with relation to the Rule; to the end that where he finds he hath done well, he may be comforted and encouraged; and where he hath done ill, he may be humbled and reformed.</p>
            <p>Thus hath he a Tribunal within his own Breaſt, before which he can, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he pleaſeth, ſummon himſelf to
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:61506:242"/>appear, demand an account of all that hath been done by himſelf whether good or evil. At this Tribunal he can judg and paſs Sentence, acquit or condemn himſelf according to the moral Nature and Quality of his Actions. Here he can rebuke and admoniſh as there ſhall be cauſe, recal and reduce himſelf where he hath gone aſtray, and lay ſtricter and ſeverer Charges and Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on himſelf of greater Care and Watchfulneſs for the future, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his former Negligence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs ſhall be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>A moſt excellent and never-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently-admired Faculty of Man's Soul! What a rich Treaſure have we herein, if we knew how to value it and make uſe of it! But alas, how little Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do we make to our ſelves of this noble Faculty!</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the ſecond thing, the great Uſefulneſs of Self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. I have already, in what hath been ſpoken on the former Head, ſaid ſomething of the Uſefulneſs of it in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. I ſhall now deſcend to ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and ſpeak briefly to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. By reflecting on our ſelves, and taking a view of our paſt Actions, we
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:61506:242"/>come to know our ſelves: We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the State and Condition of our Souls; what Caſe we are in, and what Opinion we ought to have of our ſelves. Hereby we come to be acquainted with our ſpiritual Concernments; whether we be in the State of Nature, or in the State of Grace; whether we be in the Way to Heaven, or in the Way to Hell. Hereby we come to know what our Declinings and Decays, what our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and Improvements in Grace are; whether we go forward or backward; whether it be better with us to day than 'twas yeſterday, and this Week than 'twas laſt Week, or worſe. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we come to know the Sins that moſt prevail in us, and where our Weakneſs principally lies: Hereby we come to know our Wants and Defects, our Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and Poverty in ſpiritual Things. And of how great Concernment and Advantage is it to know our ſelves! And how little will it avail us to know much abroad, while we are Strangers at home! To underſtand the World, and to be thorowly converſant in all the Matters of it, perfectly acquainted with all the Affairs and Tranſactions thereof! To know all the Secrets of Nature; and
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:61506:243"/>to have exactly dived into, and found out all the hidden Cauſes of Things! To have made ſuch ſucceſsful Inquiries into Divine Truths, as to be able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of them to Admiration, and to give an account of all the profound and deep Myſteries of our Religion! What would all this ſignify, if after a Man hath attained to know all other things, he ſhould be ignorant of himſelf? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the ſpiritual Affairs of his own Soul, which he is infinitely more concerned to underſtand? Surely whatſoever elſe a Man hath attained to know, if he knows not himſelf, he knows nothing to any purpoſe. And he that knows himſelf as he ought to know, need not be much troubled at it though he know but little elſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. By reflection on our ſelves we come to have the Comfort of our Eſtate, and of all our good Actions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We hereby come to have the Comfort of our ſpiritual Eſtate. Tho we ſhould be in the State of Grace and Salvation, in the Favour of God, and in the Way that will undoubtedly bring us to Heaven; yet if we know it not, how can we take Comfort in it? And how can we ever know it, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:61506:243"/>on our ſelves, and a narrow In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection into our Hearts and Ways? Some doubtful Conjectures we may make, ſome dark Gueſſes there may be concerning our Eſtate; but we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to attain any certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, any clear, diſtinct and well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Satisfaction touching our Condition, without a ſerious Reflection on our Souls, and a due ſearch into, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our Hearts and Ways.</p>
            <p>And indeed this is one great Cauſe, among others, of the ſmall Comfort that many true Believers have in their Eſtate: They ſeldom reflect to any purpoſe on themſelves; they ſeldom take any pains by diligent ſearch and inquiry to ſatisfy themſelves touching their Condition. hence it comes to paſs, that tho they be ſound for the main, tho they be in the right Way to Heaven, and are ſtill going on in it ſlowly and leiſurely; yet they are full of Fears, Doubtings and Diſſatisfactions; and if they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a little Comfort in their Eſtate, yet they preſently loſe it again.</p>
            <p>But now frequent and ſerious Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on themſelves, and an exact In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into their Eſtate, and a review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Matters as they ſtand within
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:61506:244"/>them, and a taking an account of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how would it after ſome time by degrees ſo clear up their Condition to them, as all their Fears would be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, all the Cloudineſs and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Minds would be ſcattered, and their Doubtings and Diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vaniſh! For we muſt take it for granted, that though there may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Weakneſſes in Believers, and frequent Relapſes into Sin; yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Bent, unfeigned Deſires, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Endeavours of the Soul are in all things to pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Now whereſoever this is, (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without this there is no true Grace) I ſay, whereſoever this is, a diligent and frequent Inquiry into our ſelves will diſcover it, and diſcover it ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a Man cannot but own it, and readily acknowledg, that amid many and great Weakneſſes, there hath been all along ſome ſincere and unfeigned Deſire and Endeavour to pleaſe God in all things. Whence we may conclude, that as it cannot eaſily be, but that a ſound and ſincere Chriſtian, who makes frequent Reflections on, and Inquiries into himſelf, ſhould evidently diſcern his own Sincerity; ſo having diſcerned
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:61506:244"/>it, he cannot but have Comfort in it, at leaſt according to the meaſure of the clearneſs of his diſcovery of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay it again, one great Cauſe why many true Believers have ſo little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in their Eſtates, is this, That they ſo ſeldom have any ſerious Reflections on themſelves, or apply themſelves to make a diligent Inquiry into their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. This, this is a great Reaſon why they walk ſo heavily and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, why they are ſo often overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fears and Perplexities, why inſtead of continual Thankſgivings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for his rich Grace and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mercy vouchſafed them, their Mouths are full of Complaints, and their Diſcourſes made up of little elſe than ſad diſcoveries of their inward Troubles and Diſſatisfactions, and the Conflicts they continually have with Doubting and Unbelief. How much ſound Comforts and Refreſhings do we loſe by being ſuch Strangers at home? What Peace and Joy in believing! what increaſes of Faith, and further degrees of Eſtabliſhment might we attain, if we were better acquainted with, and more converſant in this Self-reflection?</p>
            <pb n="472" facs="tcp:61506:245"/>
            <p n="2">2. We hereby come to have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of all our good Actions. There is an inward Peace, Joy, Content and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which uſually attends ſincere Obedience, notwithſtanding the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities accompanying us in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, and the manifold Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of it: But much of this Comfort is loſt for want of looking back and reviewing what we have done, and in what manner; with what ſincere Deſires to be accepted with God therein; with what Senſe of and mourning over the Corruption cleaving to our beſt Actions, though we cannot be rid of it: With what Watchfulneſs and Oppoſition made againſt the Sin that dwelleth in us, which would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe and mingle it ſelf with every good thing we take in hand, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty we perform. Theſe things more or leſs are to be found, and may be obſerved in every ſound Chriſtian: and Matter of very great Comfort they are to him who can diſcover them in himſelf. But alas! neglecting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view our Actions, when they are over, inſtead of the Comforts we might have in ways of Obedience, too often nothing but Trouble and inward Regret fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:61506:245"/>When we have done our beſt, we queſtion our Sincerity in all that we have done, for the Workings of our corrupt Nature, and the ſinful Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our Services come to our Remembrance, and are freſh in our Memories; but the Oppoſition we made againſt them is either hid from our Eyes, or forgotten: And all this for want of a ſerious Reflection on what hath paſt, and a careful reviewing of our Actions, together with the manner of them, and all their concomitant Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. As reflecting on our Ways and reviewing our Actions, we never want Matter of Humiliation; ſo the upright and ſound Chriſtian never wants Matter of Comfort alſo in the Sincerity of his Heart. Theſe two go together, and very well agree; a ſight and ſenſe of our Failings, with true Humiliation for them, and Comfort in the Uprightneſs of our Hearts amidſt thoſe Failings. The Truth is, theſe two are ſo far from being inconſiſtent, that we never have ſounder Comfort in our Obedience, than when we moſt clearly diſcern and moſt heartily bewail our Failings. To ſee and mourn over our Defects, and yet even then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:61506:246"/>that God accepts of our weak but ſincere Endeavours, through Chriſt: how doth this fill our Hearts not only with Joy, but humble Admiration, that God ſhould have ſuch Reſpect unto, and ſo kindly accept of ſuch poor and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Services as we preſent him with, and that notwithſtanding all the Stains and Blemiſhes that are upon them, for which he might moſt juſtly loath both us and them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By Reflection on our ſelves we come to diſcover our Sins, and have a Sight of the Errors and Miſcarriages of our Life. He who never reviews his Actions, nor conſiders what he hath done, how many Sins may he cheriſh, how many Abominations may he take Pleaſure in, what Filthineſs and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may he even wallow in, and take no notice of them, much leſs lay them to Heart? How quietly may he ſleep in thoſe Sins which without timely and ſound Repentance will inevitably ruine him? How confidently and fool-hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may ſuch an one he haſtning on in the way that leads to Deſtruction, and never come to have his Eyes open to diſcern his fearful Condition till he find himſelf to be in Hell? But now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:61506:246"/>on our Hearts and Ways being a Means of opening our Eyes, and of bringing us to the Knowledg of our Sins, is attended with three unvaluable Benefits.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It quickens us to the Uſe of Means for obtaining the Pardon of thoſe Sins, which without Pardon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, would eternally condemn us.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It's a Means of keeping off many temporal Evils which thoſe Sins unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of might bring upon us in this World, or of mitigating thoſe Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which light upon us for them: For when we are ſoundly humbled for our Sins, and have obtained the Pardon of them, either God forbears to chaſten us for them, according to that of the Apoſtle; <hi>If we would judg our ſelves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.31.</note> 
               <hi>we ſhould not be judged of the Lord:</hi> or the Sting of thoſe his Chaſtiſements being pluck'd out by Repentance, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs obtained, they are much leſs bitter and grievous unto us; and we bear them more quietly and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It prevents our running on in thoſe Sins, and our heaping up ſtill more and more Guilt upon our own Heads.</p>
            <pb n="476" facs="tcp:61506:247"/>
            <p n="4">(4.) He that inureth himſelf to this Courſe of reflecting on himſelf, and communing with his own Heart daily, ſhall never want either good Company, or comfortable Employment.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. He ſhall never want good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. In his moſt ſecret Retirements and greateſt Solitarineſs, he will be good Company for himſelf. What <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith of the Commandments of God;
<note place="margin">Prov. 6.22</note> 
               <hi>When thou goeſt, they ſhall lead thee; when thou ſleepeſt, they ſhall keep thee; and when thou awakeſt, they ſhall talk with thee.</hi> That may be ſaid of a Man who is much in reflecting upon himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning with his own Heart; when he walks, he is a Companion to himſelf; when he lies him down to take his Reſt, he ſleeps with himſelf, he is his own Bed-fellow, he needs no other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and when he awakes, he talks with himſelf. If all others ſhould withdraw and eſtrange themſelves from him, yet he would not much complain as long as he hath ſuch good Company within his own Breaſt.
<note place="margin">Pro. 14.14.</note> 
               <hi>A good Man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf.</hi> He never enjoys himſelf better than while he is at home, and converſant with himſelf. 'Tis not ſo with wicked Men,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:61506:247"/>they hate to be at home, they cannot endure to be acquainted with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they ſhun their own Company; the Conſcience they have of their own Guilt, makes them afraid to look into their own Hearts. They run away from themſelves as they would from an Enemy.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. He never wants comfortable Imployment: He could find Work enough within himſelf, though he had nothing to do abroad: He could with greateſt Content and Satisfaction take up and entertain himſelf in communing with his own Heart; he is not afraid to look inward, or to know too much of himſelf: 'tis not an unpleaſing and irkſom thing to him to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to take an Account of his own Actions; he is uſed to theſe things, and his Soul looks for them; and without them it can no more enjoy it ſelf than a Man can live comfortably without the daily Recruits of Strength and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, by moderate Sleep and wholſom Diet. If through any Avocation or Divertiſement he be a Stranger to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a little time, he is as a Fiſh out of its proper Element. And that which will not eaſily be believed by thoſe who
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:61506:248"/>have little Acquaintance with theſe things, even thoſe Parts of this Work which ſeem to be moſt unacceptable, moſt troubleſom and grievous, are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful to him. He is glad not only when he can diſcern and read his Evidences of true Grace and Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but when by Search into himſelf he can find out the ſecret Hypocriſies that lurk in his Heart; when he can make Diſcovery of any Sin within him, which before he took no notice of. A Man would not have a Moth in his Clothes, or a Thief in his Family, if he could chuſe; but if they be there, he is glad when he finds them out, that he may be rid of them. So he that truly hates Sin, is glad when he can make Diſcovery of it in himſelf, that he may ſet himſelf againſt it, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it, though indeed he ſhould be more glad if it were not there to be diſcovered.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come now to the Miſchiefs of the Neglect of Self-reflection, and they are many and great; I ſhall mention ſome of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Cauſe of hardning the Heart. There is ſcarce any thing that
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:61506:248"/>more conduceth to the keeping of the Heart ſoft and tender, than a frequent reviewing of our Actions, and calling our ſelves to an Account of what we have done. He who conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves this Courſe, who looks back and conſiders his Ways, reviews his Thoughts, Words and Actions, and reckons with himſelf for them daily, ſhall find that he is both more afraid of yielding to Temptations, and venturing upon Sin when it preſents it ſelf, and more troubled after the commiſſion thereof: He can neither be ſo eaſily prevailed with to give way to Sin, nor be ſo quiet, ſo ſenſleſs and ſecure after he hath given way to it, or been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with it: He uſually cloſeth not with Sin freely and readily, but with ſome Reluctancy, and after ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Conflicts with himſelf, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance made againſt it: and having been worſted in the Conflict, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, his awakened Conſcience gives him no Reſt until he hath been hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for his Sin, and made his Peace with God. But he who ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reflects on himſelf, or takes any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Ways, gives his Conſent to the commiſſion of Sin freely and
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:61506:249"/>readily, yea ſwallows it down greedily; and having ſo done, he alſo ſleeps in it as ſoundly and ſecurely for the moſt part: No Remorſe, no inward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble takes hold of him to quicken him to Repentance, and haſten his Return to God. Thus I mean ordinarily it is with him, unleſs where ſome horrid Guilt awakens his Conſcience, or God makes extraordinary Impreſſions of his Wrath upon the Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Miſchief of neglecting to reflect on our ſelves, is a daily Increaſe of Sin, and a treaſuring up of Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath. This is an unavoidable Conſequent of the former Miſchief. When the Heart is once hardned, and a Brawnineſs grown over the Conſcience, what ſhould put a Stop to Sin? What ſhould hold in corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or ſet any Bounds to the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Workings, to the Exceſſes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies of it? To an hardned Heart and a ſeared Conſcience, neither the Evil of Sin in it ſelf conſidered, nor the Danger and diſmal Conſequents of it, nor the Threatnings of God, nor the Examples of his terrible Judgments upon others for Sin, will ſignify any thing. The Hardneſs of a Man's Heart,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:61506:249"/>and the brawny Inſenſibleneſs of his Conſcience, are as Armour of Proof againſt all theſe things. This woful Conſequent of not reflecting on our ſelves, and requiring an Account of our Actions, we may gather from the Prophets Complaint concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and incorrigible Jews of his time:
<note place="margin">Jer. 8.6.</note> 
               <hi>No Man repented him of his Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one turned to his Courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth into the Battel.</hi> That Men ran on ſo deſperately upon Sin, was becauſe no Man ſaid, <hi>What have I done?</hi> None reflected, called himſelf to an Account of his Doings, or took into ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the woful Iſſues and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of his ſinful Courſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Miſchief hereof is, that the longer any Man neglects to look into his ſpiritual Eſtate, and conſider his Doings, the more unwilling ſtill he will be to reckon with himſelf. 'Tis with the Sinner in this Caſe as 'tis with a careleſs Merchant, who hath long neglected to ſum up his Books, and to enquire in what Condition he is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goes forward or backward in his Eſtate, whether he be a Loſer or a Gainer by his Trading. If he hath
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:61506:250"/>long gone on in this careleſs way, and eſpecially if he hath withal been laviſh and prodigal in his Expences, he will be very unwilling to acquaint himſelf with the true State of his Accounts. He is afraid he ſhall find himſelf in a bad Condition, and therefore he ſtill goes on in his old careleſs way. So the longer the Sinner hath neglected to reckon with himſelf, the more unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him are the Thoughts of coming to an Account: His Conſcience tells him he hath run far in Arrears with God, and therefore he ſhuns the Thoughts of looking over his Debts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And yet without coming to a Reckoning, which is a further Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and the greateſt of all, he can never hope to have his Debts cancell'd or remitted. The Pardon of his many and grievous Sins will never be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs he judg himſelf for them, unleſs he be truly humbled for them, and forſake them. There is no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Forgiveneſs upon any other Terms. But how far is be from this, who cannot endure to think of taking a View of his Sins, who hates the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his Sins, and carefully ſhuns and avoids whatever might bring him
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:61506:250"/>to the Sight of them? Never dream of obtaining the Forgiveneſs of your Sins as long as 'tis thus with you. And if your Sins be not forgiven you, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Miſery will be your Portion, and it had been better for you if you had never been born.</p>
            <p>To apply this briefly.</p>
            <p>All you then who could never yet be perſwaded to ſpend any Time, or take any Pains in looking into your ſelves, and reviewing your Actions, and the various Paſſages of your Life, what is it that makes you ſo unwilling to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your ſelves, and ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to decline whatſoever might bring you to a right Underſtanding of the Eſtate of your Souls? Are you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better, becauſe you do not know how bad you are? Is either your Sin or your Danger the leſs, becauſe you do not ſee it? Is it any Security to you againſt the Judgments of God, that you turn away your Eyes from your Sins, and will not look upon them? If you were running on upon a Precipice, or a ſteep Place where you might break your Neck, would the blindfolding of your ſelf, or the ſhutting of your Eyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you? Would not your Danger be
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:61506:251"/>the ſame whether you ſee it or no? Is not your Danger ſo much the greater, and your Deſtruction, if you ſtill go on, ſo much the more certain and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable, becauſe you wilfully cloſe your Eyes, that you may not be ſenſible of it? Remember your ſelves, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in what Rank God hath placed you. You are rational Creatures; Why then ſhould you act ſo irrationally? God hath made you Men; Why ſhould you make your ſelves like the Beaſts that periſh?</p>
            <p>To take you off from this Folly, or rather Madneſs, I ſhall recommend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two things to your ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and they are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hath given you that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Faculty of Self-reflection, whereof I have been diſcourſing, that looking in upon your ſelves, and making diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Sin and Danger, you might prevent your Ruine. Now if you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſe to make uſe of it, and on purpoſe either ſhut your Eyes, or turn them another way that you may not ſee your ſelf, nor diſcover your Sin and Danger, how juſt will your Ruine be, and to whom can you impute the cauſe of your Deſtruction but to your ſelves,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:61506:251"/>who would wilfully run upon it? This may, perhaps, ſeem to have but little in it now; but time will come when it ſhall be an Heart-piercing Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you ſhould have procured all your Miſery to your ſelf, by obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſing to make uſe of that Faculty of your Soul beſtowed upon you on purpoſe, that reviewing your Sins, you might be ſenſible of the Miſery that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them, and uſe Means to eſcape it. We read of the Oſtrich,
<note place="margin">Job 39.14, 15, 17.</note> that ſhe <hi>leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, and warmeth them in the Duſt; and forgetteth that the Foot may cruſh them, or that the wild Beast may break them; becauſe God hath depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her of Wiſdom, neither hath he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> God hath not endued her with a Faculty of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing and providing againſt Danger. But it cannot be ſaid of you, that God has not imparted to you Underſtanding; he hath given you Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding enough to uſe Means for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding againſt your own Deſtruction, but however you will run headlong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How averſe ſoever you be now from reflecting on your ſelf, hereafter you muſt reflect whether you will or
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:61506:252"/>no: Though you do what you can to cloſe your Eyes for the preſent, yet the time is coming when you ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to open them. When God awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens your Conſcience, and ſets all your Sins in order before you, then it will not be in your Power to refuſe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect; then you will not be able to ſeek it your ſelf: your horrid Guilt and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Provocations, whitherſoever you look, will ſtill be full in your Eyes. This will certainly be either in this World, or in that which is to come: And O with what Horror and Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Spirit will that Reflection be! <hi>David</hi>'s Condition was ſad,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.3.</note> when he complained that his <hi>Sin was ever before him.</hi> His Thoughts were always upon it; it was continually in his Eye, and he could not be rid of it. What think you then of the Damned in Hell! How fearful will their Condition be, when all their Sins ſhall be laid before them, and be repreſented to them in their full Magnitude, and with all their Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations: and when their Minds ſhall be ſo intent upon them, and their Thoughts ſo continually taken up with them, as that there ſhall be no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or Diverſion for ever to give the
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:61506:252"/>leaſt Mitigation of their Torments? When thoſe dreadful and unceſſant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections ſhall be, what would a Man then give to purchaſe a few Hours for Self-humbling and penitential Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in order to the attaining of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? If you have any ſenſe of your Eternal Concernments, be perſwaded to reflect now, and to do it ſeriouſly, that you may never have experience of the Horror and Dreadfulneſs of thoſe After-reflections in another World.</p>
            <p>And thus much of Self-reflection in the general. I now come to ſpeak of it with relation to the time of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for to that Seaſon hath the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation in the Text reference, <hi>Let us ſearch and try our Ways.</hi> Theſe two words, <hi>ſearch</hi> and <hi>try,</hi> import the ſame thing; and the Prophet uſeth two words to the ſame purpoſe, to note with what Diligence and Induſtry we muſt ſearch, as I have before, in the Explication of the Words, obſerved. 'Tis indeed a diligent Search that each of the Words, taken ſeverally, imports, and much more being joined together.</p>
            <p>Which Diligence is in this Work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, and neceſſary in ſeveral reſpects:
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:61506:253"/>and there is great reaſon why we ſhould be urged to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis a Buſineſs we have no great mind to meddle with. 'Tis no eaſy matter to draw us on and engage us to ſet upon this Work of ſearching into our Hearts and Ways; we could more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be doing any thing elſe: And when we ſet about it, we are very apt to do it ſlightly and careleſly. For proof hereof, I need do no more than appeal to every Man's Conſcience. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there who are ſo averſe from it, that they could never yet be gotten to ſet about it? And as for others, that are not wholly Strangers to it, yet how ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is it done by them, and how over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſlackly for the moſt part! Yea, though Affliction be the proper Seaſon for it, and though then we are more concern'd to do it, and our preſent Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences ſhould put us upon it; yet even then how often is it neglected, when no other Means from whence we think we may expect any Relief, are omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many of our Sins are not eaſily diſcerned; and therefore unleſs we ſearch diligently, we are not likely to find them. There are divers Grounds
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:61506:253"/>of the difficulty of finding out our Sins.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Our Ignorance in many things, and the falſe Notions and Principles concerning Good and Evil, which we have taken up and entertained. We are ſubject to many Miſtakes, and are apt to call Evil Good, and Good Evil; to <hi>put Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.20. And the Principles and Opinions which have once gotten poſſeſſion of us, are not eaſily relinquiſhed or quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, how unſound ſoever. From the Influence and Force of ſuch falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Miſpriſions, 'tis that many live and die in ſome Sins, never coming to the ſight of them: For if at any time they would look into their Eſtate, and ſearch out their Sins, theſe their falſe Principles caſt a Miſt before their Eyes, and hinder them from making diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them. Though there may be ſome true deſire to find out their Sins, yet as long as their Errors and Miſtakes remain with them, they ſearch after them in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The natural Self-love that is in every Man, is another thing that makes it difficult to find out our Sins. We are partial to our ſelves, and ſo favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:61506:254"/>and indulgent in our own Caſe, that we are not competent Judges. Self-love blinds us, and makes us willing to overlook thoſe Evils in our ſelves, which it may be we ſhould not only obſerve, but ſeverely cenſure in others.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Our Affection to Sin, and the Kindneſs we have for it, doth alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the difficulty of finding it out. We love our Sins, and are unwilling to part with them; and this makes us unwilling to diſcover them. So though we ſearch after them, yet 'tis but as an Officer ſearcheth after an Offender that is his Friend, or for whom he hath ſome Favour: He ſearcheth for him indeed, but as one who would not willingly light on him whom he ſearcheth for: He makes a diligent and narrow ſearch where he knows he is not; but if he come near any place where he ſuſpects he may lie hid, he is careful not to ſearch that Place too narrowly. Much after this manner do we ſearch after our Sins, eſpecially our beloved Sins, which in regard of the intire Affection we bear them, we would ſtill retain, whatever other Sins we part with.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Another Reaſon of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of diſcovering our ſins, is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:61506:254"/>of Sin. Sin diſguiſeth it ſelf, and puts on the Dreſſes and Habit of ſome other thing, that it may not be known. As Cheaters that wander up and down from Place to Place, ſhift their Clothes, and call themſelves by other Names, that they may not be diſcovered; ſo doth Sin often ſo dreſs it ſelf up, as it counterfeits ſome Grace, and Vice calls it ſelf by the Name of ſome Vertue. A ſtrong Fancy, which is no better than Self-deluſion, may be miſtaken for true Faith; Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſinful Compliance may have the Appearance of Moderation and Chriſtian Prudence; Stupidity and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs under the Hand of God may paſs for Patience; and the voluntary Hardſhips of Monkiſh Severities may be dreſſed up like Repentance, though they never reach the Change of the Heart and inner Man, in which true Repentance chiefly conſiſts. And how often do Paſſion, Bitterneſs and Evil-ſpeaking, put on the Attire and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of Zeal! Many more ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be given of Sin appearing in ſuch Colours, and hiding it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Dreſſes, as it deceives not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly others, but even the Sinner himſelf.
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:61506:255"/>Wherefore though in a Man's ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, he ſhould meet his Sin full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but, as they ſay; yet meeting it ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, he takes no notice of it, but lets it paſs, as a Man doth the Malefactor he is looking after, when he finds him not in that Apparel by which he was deſcribed. In all theſe Reſpects a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and narrow Search is neceſſary, if we be in earneſt and truly deſirous to find out our Sins.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſpoken touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difficulty of diſcovering our Sins, we may infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſome convenient Time muſt be ſet apart for this Work, when a Man may wholly apply himſelf thereunto, and when he may have nothing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract or hinder him. If a Man will find out his Sins, he muſt ſearch nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and carefully, as hath been ſaid; he muſt look into every Corner of his Heart, he muſt ſurvey and conſider all his Ways, his Thoughts, Words and Actions; how he hath carried himſelf in his general or particular Calling; how he hath diſcharged every Truſt; how he hath performed the Duties of every Relation in which he ſtands. Such a thorow Search as this will not
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:61506:255"/>eaſily be made; a few ſlight Thoughts or overly Reflections on himſelf while he is in a Croud of Buſineſſes, while his Heart and Head are full of the World, will do little towards the diſcovery of all his Sins, many of which do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in open view, but ſo withdraw and hide themſelves, as it will coſt a Man ſome time and pains to get a ſight of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he who would ſo ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Sins as to find them, muſt get his Heart affected with a true hatred of Sin, and a ſincere willingneſs to forſake it. For though Sin muſt be found out before it can be forſaken, yet a Man muſt be willing to forſake it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can readily find it out. The reaſon is, becauſe ſo long as a Man is unwilling to leave his Sin, he will be unwilling to find it, and ſo will never ſeek nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly and ſtrictly after it. When once we are fully convinc'd of the Evil and Danger of Sin; when once we hate it unfeignedly, and are reſolved to do our utmoſt to be rid of it, then ſhall we ſearch after it with a Mind to find it; then ſhall we make the moſt diligent and impartial Inquiry into our ſelves, that it may not eſcape our Eye.</p>
            <pb n="494" facs="tcp:61506:256"/>
            <p n="3">3. We may alſo further infer, that when we addreſs our ſelves to this Work, we muſt be ſuſpicious and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of our ſelves. We are too willing to favour our ſelves, and to indulge our ſelves in ſome particular Sins which have gotten an Intereſt in our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and we are furniſhed with many Colours and Artifices to cover them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and hide the Evil of them from our Eyes. 'Tis therefore fafe and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that we ſhould ſuſpect our falſe and deceitful Hearts, and preſerve a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Jealouſy of our ſelves, leſt we ſhould be too favourable and kind to thoſe Sins which lie neareſt our Hearts, whether they be profitable or pleaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sins, or of what other Nature or Quality ſoever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may likewiſe hence be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how much it concerns us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore God's Aſſiſtance in this Buſineſs; that while we apply our ſelves to ſearch and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ways, he would be pleaſed to ſearch and try us, as <hi>David</hi>'s Prayer was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23. that he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover our Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to us, and give us a Sight of them; than he would help us againſt the Deceitfulneſs of our Hearts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Self-love; that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:61506:256"/>us to ſearch ſo narrowly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially as we may not overlook our Sins: and more eſpecially, that he would be pleaſed to diſcover to us thoſe particular Sins for which he doth afflict us. Without this our Recourſe to God in Prayer, and his Aſſiſtance obtained, all our ſearching will be to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Now in the next Place, the time of Affliction is a proper Seaſon for this Duty. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then God by his Chaſtiſements doth as it were ſummon us to reflect and enquire after the Cauſe within our ſelves. <hi>The Rod of God</hi> hath a Voice,
<note place="margin">Micah 6.9.</note> and it calls upon us for this Duty. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Providence of God hath its proper Language, by which it remembers us of ſomething that is expected from us; Mercies call for Joy and Thankfulneſs, and Afflictions for Reflection and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration:
<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.14.</note> 
               <hi>In the Day of Proſperity be joyful, but in the Day of Adverſity conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> We muſt then conſider what God's Meaning and Intentions may be in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Afflictions on us, and what thoſe our Sins may be for which he ſo corrects us.</p>
            <pb n="496" facs="tcp:61506:257"/>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis then ſeaſonable to ſearch and try our Ways, becauſe that is the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt effectual Courſe we can take for obtaining the Removal of our Afflictions; I mean, if we ſearch and try our ways, in order to the finding out of our Sins, that we may forſake them, and accordingly forſake them when we have found them out: For the end of God's Chaſtiſements being the taking away of our Sins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.9. and the cleanſing and purifying of us from the Defilements thereof, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10. When God hath his End, we being turned from our evil Ways, he hath by many Promiſes aſſured us, that he will be at Peace with us. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Return O backſliding</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine Anger to fall upon you. When thou art in Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and ſhall be obedient to his Voice, he will not forſake thee, neither deſtroy thee,</hi> Deut. 4.30, 31. <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55.7. Neither particular Perſons only, but even whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:61506:257"/>returning to the Lord, find Mercy with him for the averting or removing of his Judgments:
<note place="margin">Jer. 18.7, 8:</note> 
               <hi>At what Inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it; If that Nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their Evil, I will repent me of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi> Hereupon the People of God ſorely ſmitten and wounded, are encouraged to return to him, in Confidence of Healing if they return:
<note place="margin">Hoſea 6.1.</note> 
               <hi>Come let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will bind us up.</hi> How ſad and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoever their preſent Condition were, they made no queſtion but all their Wounds ſhould be healed, and all their Breaches ſhould be made up, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to God. But now what muſt lay the Foundation of their Return? or what muſt be the firſt ſtep towards it, but a diligent Search after their Sins, by which they had departed from him? The Neglect hereof is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues and prolongs our Afflictions, whatever other Means we make uſe of to relieve our ſelves thereby. But of this more hereafter, when I come to
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:61506:258"/>ſpeak of the ſecond Duty in time of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In time of Affliction we have ſome ſpecial Advantage towards the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after and finding out of our Sins, which at other times we are deſtitute of.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Afflictions abate the Vanity and Lightneſs of our Spirits, and make us ſerious, and ſo more fit to reflect on our ſelves, and conſider our Ways. At other times our Minds will not be ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily fix'd, and our Thoughts held in and kept cloſe, to a Work which is not very pleaſing to us, and which we are apt to recoil from.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Affliction makes our Hearts ſoft, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks; it makes Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's Diſpleaſure upon our Hearts, and makes us ſenſible of his Anger. When God ſeveral ways lays his Hand upon you, then you ſay with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.17. <hi>Are not theſe things come upon us, becauſe God is not amongst us?</hi> Becauſe he in Diſpleaſure hath withdrawn from us?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Affliction makes us teachable, and willing to be informed of what is amiſs; it makes us deſirous to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what 'tis for which God hath a
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:61506:258"/>Controverſy with us: God ſpeaks to Men in their Proſperity, and they will not hear, as he complained, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. But Affliction, as God ſanctifies it to them, makes them willing to hear and learn wherein they have offended. Then they beg of God that he would teach them, as <hi>Job</hi> did in his Affliction, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Make me to know my Tranſgreſſion, and my Sin,</hi> chap. 13.23. <hi>Then God ſhews them their Work and their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that they have exceeded, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their Ear to Diſcipline,</hi> ch. 36.9, 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. God in his Wiſdom oft-times makes choice of ſuch Afflictions to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Men with, by which he, as it were, points at their Sin. When <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom</hi> and <hi>Adonijah,</hi> both of them their Father's Darlings, roſe up againſt their Father, it was no hard Matter for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> to diſcern what Sin of his God thereby intended to correct. He too fondly treated both the one and the other, and uſed much more Lenity and Indulgence towards them than was meet; and by God's wiſe and juſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they requite him accordingly. This his Miſcarriage <hi>David</hi> could not ſo well ſee before; for inordinate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and fond Love are blind; but
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:61506:259"/>now no doubt he ſaw and was made ſenſible of his Error in the Education of his Children. That God's Judgments and Chaſtiſements are often ſuch as the Sin which he puniſheth or correcteth for, may be known by them, is moſt agreeable both unto Scriptures and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. How frequently may we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſuch Children as have been ſtubborn and undutiful to their Parents, have afterwards been puniſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with undutiful and rebellious Children: that falſe and unfaithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have met with ſuch themſelves, when afterwards they have had Families of their own: that unthankful Perſons have met with as ill Requitals from thoſe who have received Kindneſſes from them: that falſe and treacherous Friends have been betrayed by thoſe on whoſe Friendſhip and Faithfulneſs they moſt depended? It ſeems good to the Wiſdom of God ſo to order and diſpoſe of the Circumſtances of his Judgments or Chaſtiſements, that either the Time, or the Place, or the Inſtrument, or the Manner, or the Matter and Object of them, have often ſome Correſpondence with, and Relation to the Sin which he chiefly aims at.</p>
            <pb n="501" facs="tcp:61506:259"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) God ſometimes points out Mens Sin by the time he takes to puniſh them. A Man hath, it may be, often offended in the ſame kind; and God hath for the moſt part ſtill diſcovered his Diſpleaſure more or leſs, by ſomewhat that the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath met with, or hath befallen him, either at or preſently upon the renewed commiſſion of that Sin. At length he offends in the ſame kind more notoriouſly; and immediately there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſome more ſevere Stroke lights upon him from the Hand of God, than ever at any time before. When thus it is, what other Conſtruction can a Man make of God's dealing with him, but that he is chaſtned for ſuch a Sin? And as for Chaſtiſements, ſo for the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, they often light on Men either in the Act, or preſently upon the commiſſion of their Sins. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was ſaying in the Pride of his Heart,
<note place="margin">Dan. 4.30, 31, 32, 33.</note> 
               <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>which I have built for the Houſe of my Kingdom, and by the Might of my Power, and for the Honour of my Majeſty? While the Word was yet in the King's Mouth, there fell a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, O King</hi> Nebuchadnezzar, <hi>to thee it is ſpoken, The Kingdom is departed from
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:61506:260"/>thee: They ſhall drive thee from Men, and thy Dwelling ſhall be with the Beaſts of the Field, and they ſhall make thee eat Graſs as Oxen. And the ſame Hour was the thing fulfilled upon</hi> Nebuchadnezzar. So afterwards when <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> was profanely carouzing and drinking Wine in the Golden Veſſels of the Temple, and <hi>praiſing his Gods of Gold and Silver,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 5.3, 4, 5, 30.</note> 
               <hi>of Braſs and of Iron, and of Wood and of Stone: In the ſame Hour came forth Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a Man's Hand, and wrote upon the Plaiſter of the Wall</hi> that Judgment which God had decreed ſhould light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King; and which accordingly that ſame Night was put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus <hi>Herod,</hi> as ſoon as he had finiſhed his Oration, and received the Applauſes of the People, crying out, <hi>It is the Voice of a God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 12.21, 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>and not of a Man: Immediately the Angel of the Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gave not God the Glory: and he was eaten of Worms, and gave up the Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Sometimes the Judgments or Chaſtiſements of God light upon Men in the very Place where they formerly had offended. So God threatned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite <hi>Ahab</hi> in that Plat,
<note place="margin">2 Kings 9.26.</note> in that very Plat of Ground where he had ſinned.
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:61506:260"/>So whereas the Iſraelites had highly provoked God to Anger, by building high Places in <hi>Tophet</hi> for their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Worſhip, and by burning their Sons and their Daughters in the Fire there; God threatned there to puniſh them for their Idolatry and Cruelty: Thus ſaith the Lord,
<note place="margin">Jer. 7.31, 32, 33.</note> 
               <hi>The Days come that it ſhall no more be called</hi> Tophet, <hi>or the Valley of the Son of</hi> Hinnom, <hi>but the Valley of Slaughter: for they ſhall bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in</hi> Tophet, <hi>till there be no Place: and the Carcaſes of the People ſhall be Meat for the Fowls of the Heaven, and for the Beaſts of the Earth, and none ſhall fray them away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Inſtruments by which God puniſheth Men, are ſometimes the ſame which were the Inſtruments of their Sin.
<note place="margin">Judg. 7.</note> Thus the <hi>Sichemites</hi> whom <hi>Abimelech</hi> made uſe of as his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Aſſiſtants in ſlaying his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, were afterwards through God's righteous Judgment a Means of the Deſtruction of <hi>Abimelech</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) God often puniſheth Men in ſuch a manner as bears ſome Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with their Sin. The Scripture is full of Inſtances hereof. If <hi>Jacob</hi> deceive his aged Father, and make him
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:61506:261"/>believe he is his eldeſt Son <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſo ſteal away the Bleſſing from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<note place="margin">Gen. 29.23</note> 
               <hi>Laban</hi> ſhall deceive him much in the like manner, giving him <hi>Leah</hi> to Wife inſtead of <hi>Rachel.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> firſt commit Adultery with <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.10, 11, 12.</note> and then contrive the murdering of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> for the concealing thereof, his Son <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom</hi> ſhall be permitted to lie with his Father's Concubines, as he had done with the Wife of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi> and as he had ſlain <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> by the Sword of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ammon,</hi> ſo the Sword ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver depart from his Houſe. If <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel</hi> take away the Life of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> becauſe he would not part with his Vineyard, and the Dogs do lick his Blood; the Sentence of <hi>Ahab</hi> from the Mouth of the Lord ſhall be, <hi>In the Place where Dogs licked the Blood of</hi> Naboth, <hi>ſhall Dogs lick thy Blood, even thine,</hi> 1 Kings 21.19. And <hi>the Dogs ſhall eat</hi> Jezebel <hi>by the VVall of</hi> Jezreel: and <hi>him that dieth of</hi> Ahab <hi>in the City, Dogs ſhall eat: and him that dieth in the Field ſhall the Fowls of the Air eat,</hi> ver. 23, 24. If <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bihu;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10.1, 2.</note> If the two hundred and fifty Men which were the Complices of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abyram,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 16.35.</note> preſume to offer
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:61506:261"/>ſtrange Fire before the Lord; by ſtrange Fire, <hi>by a Fire coming out from before the Lord ſhall they be conſumed.</hi> If the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites burn Incenſe to the Queen of Heaven upon the Tops of their Houſes,
<note place="margin">Jer. 19.13.</note> their Houſes ſhall be ſet on fire, and burnt down by the Enemy. As the Sword of <hi>Agag</hi> the King of the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> had made many Women childleſs, ſo muſt his Mother be childleſs among Women, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.33.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) God puniſheth Men in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Object in which they have ſinned. If <hi>David</hi> be proud of the Multitude of his People, and out of the Pride of his Heart will have them numbred, God will chaſten him by diminiſhing his People;
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.15.</note> threeſcore and ten thouſand of them ſhall die by the Peſtilence. If <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhaphat</hi> join himſelf with wicked <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.35, 36, 37.</note> and in compliance with him builds Ships that they may go to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> his Ships ſhall be broken, and his Purpoſes ſhall be diſappointed. Thus we have in many Inſtances ſeen the Truth of what was ſpoken, That God often makes choice of ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as point at the Sin for which they were inflicted.</p>
            <pb n="506" facs="tcp:61506:262"/>
            <p>This God doth for ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To convince thoſe who are obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately blind, and will not ſee their Sins, nor own the Evils that light on them, to be the Puniſhments of thoſe Sins. Men are naturally ſo unwilling to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their own Guilt, and that they ſuffer for their Sins, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make any other Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe Evils which befal them, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to yield that God thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to puniſh them for their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. Sometimes they will impute all to the Malice of ſecond Cauſes and the Inſtruments of their Sufferings, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looking ſo high as God, without whom no Creature could touch them: Sometimes they will fancy that ſuch Evils light upon them by chance, and not by Divine Providence ordering them for their Puniſhment or Correction. But now when God's Dealings bear ſuch a Reſemblance of, and Correſpondence with their Sins, they are forced to ſee and acknowledg their Sins, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Juſtice of God in their Puniſhment. A remarkable Example hereof we have in <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> who when his Thumbs and great Toes were cut off, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by enforced to give Glory to God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:61506:262"/>ſaying,
<note place="margin">Judg. 1.7.</note> 
               <hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings having their Thumbs and great Toes cut off, gathered their Meat under my Table: as I have done, ſo God hath requited me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To help the Weakneſs of thoſe who are in ſome meaſure willing to ſee their Sins, and to diſcern God's End in his Corrections, but cannot do it ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, unleſs ſomething in the Correction it ſelf lead them to the Sight of their Sin. Thus when a Man ſuffers in the ſame kind in which he hath been inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to others, or when a Man loſeth by thoſe unlawful Artifices by which he made account to increaſe his Gain, he cannot but take notice of his Sin in the Puniſhment, which otherwiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he would have over-look'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hereby makes the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment work more kindly and effectually. For theſe Circumſtances pointing at a Man's Sin ſo evidently, do add much to the ſmarting of the Rod with which God corrects, and makes Men take his Chaſtiſements the more to Heart. And all this ſtirs up more earneſt Deſires and Endeavours to anſwer the end of his Corrections. Phyſicians when they give gentle Phyſick, or have to do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with obſtinate or ſluggiſh Bodies,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:61506:263"/>put in ſomewhat to animate and quicken the Operation of their Preſcriptions: So God by theſe Circumſtances ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly pointing at a Man's Sin, quickens the Operation of his ſpiritual Phyſick, which without theſe Circumſtances would little affect the Patient, or ſtir thoſe bad Humours which are to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God hereby ſometimes intends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Vindication of his Juſtice and Holineſs before the World, When Men have ſinned grievouſly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>enly, ſo as the World hath taken notice of it, God will have the World alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> notice of his Severity againſt ſuch Sins: and to that end he writes the Sin in fair and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Characters upon the Puniſhment, ſo as all that paſs by may ſay, <hi>Verily there is a God that judgeth in the Earth.</hi> But now if God ſhould not thus point at the Sin by the Puniſhment, many who took notice of the Sin would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take notice of the Puniſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and conſequently God's Hatred of Sin, and his Severity againſt it would not ſo manifeſtly appear. For though God ſhould inflict as ſevere a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Sinner in ſome other kind, yet few would underſtand what Sin
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:61506:263"/>God thereby intended to puniſh; and ſo his Juſtice and Holineſs would be as little vindicated in the Judgment of the greateſt part of thoſe who had taken notice of the Sin, as if he had not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Sin at all.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God thus points at the Sin by the Puniſhment, to give warning to others, that they may take heed how they ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon thoſe Sins which they ſee are ſo odious unto God, and ſo ſeverely and remarkably puniſhed by him; that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may ſee and fear,
<note place="margin">Deut. 13.11.</note> 
               <hi>and do no more any ſuch Wickedneſs,</hi> as God ſpeaks touching the end of the Execution of Vindictive Juſtice by the Magiſtrate. So then to return to that which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of all that hath been ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral Ways of God's pointing at the Sin by the Puniſhment; by what hath been ſaid it appears that our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are a ſpecial help to lead us to the ſight of our Sins; and therefore in that reſpect as well as in others, the time of Affliction is the meeteſt Seaſon for ſearching and trying our ways. By the help that our Afflictions then afford us, we may then find out thoſe Sins which at another time we ſhould not ſo eaſily diſcover.</p>
            <pb n="510" facs="tcp:61506:264"/>
            <p>Now to apply what hath been ſpoken in a Word or two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. If this ſearching and trying of our Ways in order to the finding out and forſaking of our Sins, be the ſpecial Duty, the great Work required of us in time of Affliction, how is it that this Work is for the moſt part leaſt thought of? How is it that there is ſo much complaining among us, but ſo little Searching? ſo much enquiring after Remedies, and whatſoever other means may afford us Relief, but ſo little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after our Sins that obſtruct the Operation, and blaſt the Succeſs of all other Means? How is it that this ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trying our Ways, which ſhould be the firſt thing we do in time of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, is commonly the laſt? The laſt did I ſay? Yea rather, how is it that it is for the moſt part wholly omitted, even when no other Means that can be thought of are omitted? How is it that many Afflictions ſucceeding one after another, do ſo hardly bring us to this ſearching and trying our Ways at laſt? Surely if there were nothing elſe to prove the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of this Work, yet this were enough, that
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:61506:264"/>our corrupt Nature is ſo extreamly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from it. Such untoward Hearts and Natures have we, that the beſt things are moſt unacceptable, and moſt againſt the hair to us. Could we be perſwaded to make this our firſt Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when any Affliction firſt arreſts us, how many Trials might we avoid? And how much might we either ſhorten or ſweeten thoſe which God ſees good to exerciſe us with? Conſider the evil Conſequents of our Neglect of this Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. By Neglect hereof we do what in us lies that God may loſe the end of his Corrections.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We loſe the Benefit of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We either lengthen out preſent Afflictions, or make way for others to ſucceed, if theſe ſhould be removed. Now what extream Folly is it to run upon theſe great Evils, rather than put our ſelves to the Trouble of taking that Courſe which God puts us upon for our ſpeedy and effectual Relief! What is it that makes us ſo unwilling? Is it the Unpleaſingneſs of the Work? But all good things are ſo to our ſinful Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. What is diſpleaſing at firſt, will become pleaſant and delightful af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:61506:265"/>you ſhall have been inured to it.</p>
            <p>Is it your Love to ſome particular Sin, and your Unwillingneſs to leave it? If that be at the bottom, take heed of it; you do but harbour a Snake in your Boſom, that will ſting you to Death if you ſtill cheriſh it: that Sin as dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you love it, will certainly be your Ruine, unleſs you find it out and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it.</p>
            <p>Is it your Sloth and Unwillingneſs to be at the Coſt of ſo much Pains, as a narrow Search into your Heart and Ways would require? But,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Can you take Pains to better Purpoſe? Is there any thing in the World that better deſerves your Pains?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Do you not take a great deal more Pains about Matters of ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in compariſon of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your Soul, and your Peace with God? Can you be content to lay out your Strength and ſpend your Spirits in purſuit of the things of the World, and yet ſtick at a little Pains to be taken about your ſpiritual Eſtate? Have you not ſome time heretofore taken a great deal more Pains in purſuit of Sin and ſinful Vanities, than the ſearching into your Heart and Ways need coſt you?
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:61506:265"/>Have you not often tired your ſelf in the Ways of Sin with greateſt Delight; and yet are you ſo nice and tender, ſo indulgent and favourable to your ſelf, as you cannot now be perſwaded to be at the Expence of a little Pains to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how Matters ſtand between God and your Soul? If this be your Temper, you muſt not think of going to Heaven upon theſe Terms: You muſt reſolve to take Pains, or you ſhall never get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There muſt be <hi>ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait Gate;</hi> and <hi>working out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling;</hi> and a <hi>taking the Kingdom of Heaven by Violence,</hi> or you will fall ſhort of it. What ſay you to theſe things? Are you at length perſwaded and reſolved to take ſome Pains to make a ſtrict Search into your ſelf? And is it the full Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of your Heart to overlook no Sin that by your moſt diligent and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Enquiry you can diſcover? Then for your Direction herein,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Make uſe of that Help which the Circumſtances of God's Chaſtiſements offer you. Try what you may thence gain towards the Diſcovery of the Sin whereby you have provoked God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict you.</p>
            <pb n="514" facs="tcp:61506:266"/>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Conſider the Circumſtance of time when God was firſt pleaſed to lay his Hand upon you. Enquire what you had been then doing, and whether your Affliction did not arreſt you even while you were acting Sin in one kind or other, or whether it did not follow ſome Sin at the Heels.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Enquire whether the Place where your Affliction ſeized on you, were not that in which you had ſinned. It may be it ſeized on you in your Shop, where you had been cheating ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; in the Ale-houſe, where you had been miſpending your time, and abuſing your ſelf by Intemperance; or it may be in ſome other Place as bad or worſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Conſider the Inſtruments of your Affliction. Doth not God puniſh you by thoſe who were your Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Sin? or whoſe Aſſiſtance you made uſe of for the commiſſion of your Sin? Doth he not take thoſe very things with which you ſinned, and make them the Inſtruments of your Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Enquire whether there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the manner of God's chaſtening you, that may lead you to the Sight of your Sin. He hath chaſtened you with
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:61506:266"/>the Scourge of the Tongue; have not you abuſed your Tongue to the defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and injuring of others in the ſame kind? You have met with falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Dealings from thoſe whom you thought you might have truſted: Have not you been as falſe and deceitful your ſelf? And doth not God meaſure to you according to the Meaſure that others have received from you? God lays bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Weakneſſes and Infirmities on you: Are they not the proper Effects of your Intemperance, and other lewd and debauched Courſes, by which you have brought thoſe Diſtempers and Weakneſſes upon you? God afflicts you in your Children: Have not you ſet your Affections too much upon them? Or have you not neglected them in their Education? Or have you not given them ill Example?</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Conſider the Matter and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your Affliction, and ſee if that may not help you to ſee your Sin. God hath taken away part of your Eſtate from you: When you had more than now you have, did you not abuſe it? God hath blaſted your Beauty: Were you not proud of it? God hath poured Reproach and Contempt upon you:
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:61506:267"/>Did you not forfeit your good Name and Reputation, and make your ſelf vile by your Sins? Have you not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured God, for which he hath juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made you to be lightly eſteemed?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Compare your ſelf with the Rule: lay the Law of God before you, and try your ſelf thereby in reference to all the ſeveral Branches thereof. <hi>By the Law comes the Knowledg of Sin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.20.</note> And here reſt not in Generalities, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Particulars. Take an Account of your ſelf, and make Enquiry where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have declined or ſwerved from any part of that Duty which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of you. He that lays any one of God's Laws before him, taking only the general Letter of it as 'tis expreſs'd in the Commandment, may think he hath not much failed of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what the Law requires; yea perhaps he may be ready to juſtify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying with the young Man in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Mat. 19.20.</note> 
               <hi>All this have I kept from my Youth:</hi> And yet when he comes to look more narrowly into the ſeveral Parts of his Duty contained under that Law, he may find he hath offended many Ways, and that he hath not only come far ſhort of exact Conformity
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:61506:267"/>to the Rule, but failed more or leſs in almoſt every thing that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, excepting only thoſe fouler Acts of Sin which in the Letter of ſome of the Commandments are by Name forbidden.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this Search be ſure that you avoid that common Error of heeding and looking after Sins of Commiſſion only, little or not at all regarding Sins of Omiſſion. Though we make light of our Omiſſions, yet they may be ſuch as God may be highly provoked by them.</p>
            <p>To neglect Prayer in your Family, and the Inſtruction of thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Charge, may be ſmall Sins in your Account, and ſcarce worth the taking notice of. But they are not ſo in God's Account: He ſees that the Omiſſion of theſe Duties is the ready way to bring upon us a Deluge of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, Irreligion and Atheiſm: and that they who make no Conſcience of theſe Duties, do in effect ſay unto God, <hi>Depart from us;</hi> they do what in them lies to baniſh God, not only out of their Families, but out of the Land: For if theſe Duties ſhould be as ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected by all as they are by
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:61506:268"/>ſome, and thoſe too many, what would become of our Poſterity in the next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration? Would not the whole Face of the Land be covered with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as thick as that of <hi>Egypt?</hi> And what would attend that Darkneſs, but all manner of Ungodlineſs and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, the inſeparable Conſequents of Ignorance?</p>
            <p>The total Omiſſion of ſecret Prayer you may think is no great Matter, ſo long as you ſometimes in publick or private join with others in that Duty: but God hath other Thoughts of it; he knows that all your other Services, as by you performed, are little better than mere Formalities, as long as you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſecret Duties. He knows the great Conſequence of keeping up a conſtant Courſe of ſecret Prayer, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it 'tis impoſſible that either your Heart or Converſation ſhould be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered aright. He knows that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Life and Vigour of all other Duties depends on this.</p>
            <p>The Neglect of ſhewing Mercy to thoſe that are afflicted, you may think is no great Matter, ſo long as you do no Man any Wrong; but God lays more Streſs upon ſuch Omiſſions than
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:61506:268"/>you do; his righteous Sentence is, He that hath no Pity for others,
<note place="margin">Pro. 21.13 Jam. 2.13.</note> ſhall have none himſelf; <hi>He ſhall have Judgment without Mercy, that hath ſhewed no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Neglect of ſome one publick Ordinance, as the Lord's Supper for example, you may think is a thing that God takes little notice of, ſo long as you give your conſtant Attendance on other Ordinances: but you conſider not how much Evil and Danger there is in the deliberate and wilful Omiſſion of any known Duty, and ſuch is this. For ſuch an Omiſſion as this was <hi>Moſes</hi> in Danger of loſing his Life;
<note place="margin">Exod. 4.24, 25, 26.</note> for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to circumciſe his Son, <hi>the Lord met him,</hi> took hold of him, <hi>and ſought to kill him:</hi> neither would he let him go, till <hi>Zipporah his Wife had taken a ſharp Stone, and cut off the Foreskin of her Son.</hi> Neither may you think that any colourable Excuſe that you may pretend you have for Neglect of a Duty or an Ordinance, will bear you out. <hi>Moſes</hi> in Probability might have pleaded ſomething for his Excuſe: his Wife <hi>Zipporah,</hi> as it ſeems by her Carriage, was extreamly averſe from having her Son circumciſed, ſo that <hi>Moſes</hi> could
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:61506:269"/>not do it, but there would be a Breach between them; there would be no Quiet in the Family. This Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been ſomewhat, if the thing had been of an indifferent Nature, and not a Matter of Duty: but where God's expreſs Command was, That every Male-child ſhould be Circumciſed, this Excuſe could not juſtify <hi>Moſes</hi> his Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Look well to it that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes be good, by which you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your abſenting your ſelf from any Ordinance of God. It had need be a ſtrong and a clear Ground on which you go, when you ſhall willingly and upon Deliberation wave an expreſs Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. But this by the way.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Think not you have done enough if you have been ſearching within, and round about you near at hand; if you have with ſome Diligence enquired how Matters are with you at preſent, or have been of late; but look farther off, and ſurvey the former part of your paſt Life: God may call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance Sins long ſince committed, and chaſten you for them. Thus God brought a Famine of three Years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21.1</note> for <hi>Saul</hi>'s Cruelty againſt the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> though
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:61506:269"/>
               <hi>Saul</hi> had then been dead many Years. Yea, God may chaſten you for old Sins, though you have long ſince left them; and this for ſeveral Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Though you have left them, yet it may be that you never truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them. A Man may break off the Practice of ſome Sins, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not with his temporal Advantage, or his Credit, or his worldly Deſigns and Intereſt. Upon ſuch Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe a Man may have forſaken ſome particular Sins, though he never hated them, nor was truly humbled for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. A Man may have truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Sin, he may have been truly humbled for it, and forſaken it, and yet he may ſtill want ſome Degrees of that thorow Humiliation which God expecteth.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Former Sins long ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and forſaken, may now be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgotten; at leaſt they may not be remembred with that freſh and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Senſe of the great Evil and Hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, with that mourning over them, and loathing of our ſelves for them, as heretofore.</p>
            <pb n="522" facs="tcp:61506:270"/>
            <p n="4">4thly. God may ſee that you are in Danger of returning to thoſe Sins again, that you have long ſince forſaken, and verily thought your ſelf at ſo great a diſtance from them, as you ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any Inclination to commit them again. So then 'tis poſſible that God may afflict you for old Sins, long ſince forſaken upon ſome worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that he may bring you to ſound Repentance for them; or that he may more throughly humble you for the Sins that you have truly repented of; or that he may thereby rub up and renew the Remembrance of former Sins, and therewith alſo renew your former Sorrow, and loathing of your ſelf for thoſe Sins, which Time and Forgetfulneſs, and carnal Security, have almoſt worn out; and laſtly, that he may prevent your Relapſes into the ſame Sins. Thus you ſee that God may have many Reaſons to correct you for former Sins; and therefore that if you will find out the Sin for which he chaſtens you, it will ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you to caſt your Eye far back, and take a View of thoſe your former Sins, which you have long ago quitted and relinquiſhed.</p>
            <pb n="523" facs="tcp:61506:270"/>
            <p n="5">5thly. This ſearching and trying your Ways is a Work that muſt be often repeated; and that not only in regard that you every Day contract new Guilt, and run afreſh in Arrears with God, but becauſe your former Sins may not be diſcovered preſently, though you ſearch after them with ſome good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Care and Diligence. When we ſearch after a thing which much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us to find, though we light not on it at firſt, yet we ſearch a ſecond and a third time, and will not eaſily give over ſearching until we have found it. You have been making Search after the Sin for which God afflicts you, and you cannot find it; you are ſtill in the dark, and cannot underſtand God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in laying his Hand upon you: But ſearch yet once more, yea a third and a fourth time, if need be; you may light on that at laſt which you have often overlook'd. Whatever the Iſſue of your Enquiry be, you will not loſe your Labour. He who digged up all his Vineyard, in hope to find the Treaſure which he had been told was hid there, though he found not the Treaſure he look'd after, yet he had it in another kind which he expected
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:61506:271"/>not: the looſening and mellowing of the Earth brought him in a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Vintage the next Year. If by your Search you ſhould not at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any one particular Sin, which you can think God aimed at in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which he hath laid upon you, yet you may light on ſomewhat elſe which may requite your Pains. If no other Benefit accrue to you, yet the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction you have in having uſed ſo much Diligence in reviewing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Paſſages of your Life, will be a ſufficient Recompence of the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you have been at therein. But yet this is not all; there are divers other certain Advantages which redound to us from taking a view of our former Sins, and which, if it be done in a due manner, we never fail of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though we find not the particular Sin which we look'd after. It makes us more humble; it raiſeth our Eſteem and Valuation of Chriſt; it fills us with Admiration of the free Grace and rich Mercy of God in pardoning ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo great Sins; it inflames our Love, and increaſeth our Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God; and it quickens us to more Care and Watchfulneſs, to a
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:61506:271"/>more conſtant and ſerious Endeavour of ſincere and univerſal Obedience for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Now though it be moſt ſeaſonable to ſearch and try our Ways in time of Affliction, yet there are alſo ſome other ſpecial Seaſons for this Duty. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. At any time when we are in any great Fear or Danger; then though God doth not yet ſtrike us, yet he ſhakes his Rod over us; and therefore to prevent what may be coming upon us, and to avert thoſe Evils which we fear, there can be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> better Courſe than that we make a through Search after thoſe our Sins, for which God ſeems to threaten us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. After a Man hath fallen into any great Sin: Such Falls do for the moſt part fore-run ſome Affliction, and make for the preſent a Breach between God and us: For the cloſing up of which Breach, and renewing of our Peace with God, it will concern us not only to be humbled for that particular Sin, but to make diligent Enquiry after ſuch other Sins as may interpoſe between God and us, and deprive us of the Light of his Countenance, and the Senſe of his Love.</p>
            <pb n="526" facs="tcp:61506:272"/>
            <p n="3">3. When we are in Expectation of, or Suitors unto God for any ſpecial Mercy. For conſidering that our Sins ſeparate between God and us, and withhold good things from us, nothing can be more ſeaſonable or neceſſary, than that when we are waiting on God for any ſpecial Favour, we carefully ſearch and try our Ways, that no Sin may hinder our Mercies, obſtruct the Paſſage of them to us, or blaſt the Means which we make uſe of for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Before our more ſolemn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Approaches unto God; as namely, before our drawing near unto the Table of the Lord. God will be ſanctified in all our Approaches unto him; but eſpecially in our moſt ſolemn Approaches. And in particular, as concerning our drawing near unto the Table of the Lord, a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Search into our ſelves at that time, is in ſeveral Reſpects ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In regard of the expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.28.</note> 
               <hi>Let a Man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) In regard of the great Danger of coming unworthily: <hi>He that eateth
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:61506:272"/>and drinketh unworthily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> 
               <hi>eateth and drinketh Damnation to himſelf.</hi> Now unleſs a Man ſearch and try his Heart and Ways, how can he know whether he be an unworthy Receiver or no? He muſt needs run a great Hazard who comes Hand over Head, before he hath enquired into himſelf, whether he be a meet Gueſt for the Table of the Lord or not. Yea, 'tis very much to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he who is ſo careleſs as that he never enquires into his Fitneſs, comes unpreparedly, and eats and drinks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) In regard of the great Benefits which we ſhall reap thereby, and the Uſefulneſs thereof, in relation to the Sacrament.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. In that Ordinance we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail and mourn over our Sins; we muſt come to it with godly Sorrow for them: And how can that be unleſs we know them? And how can we come to know them, unleſs we ſearch after them? 'Tis the reviewing of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ſets before us the Sins for which we are to be humbled, and affects our hearts with them.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. We are at that Ordinance to renew our Covenant with God, and
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:61506:273"/>to take up freſh Reſolutions of cleaving to him with full purpoſe of Heart for the future. And what is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing hereunto, than that we by a narrow Search into our ſelves, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how and wherein we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from God, and broken Covenant with him?</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We are there to act Faith on Chriſt for the Pardon of our Sins; and we there expect to have the Pardon of them ſealed unto us: in both which Reſpects it is then moſt ſeaſonable and requiſite that we ſhould look back and take a Survey of our former Sins. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hereby we ſhall come to know what, and how many and great thoſe Sins are, for the Pardon whereof we are to act Faith on Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhall be the better able to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue that Pardon of ſo many and ſo great Sins which he is pleaſed in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to ſeal to us; and conſequently we ſhall the better underſtand how much Love and Thankfulneſs is due from us, both unto Chriſt who hath with his Blood purchaſed the Pardon of our Sins for us, and to God the Father, who for Chriſt's ſake hath beſtowed it on us.</p>
            <pb n="529" facs="tcp:61506:273"/>
            <p n="4">4thly. If this Search and Trial of our ſelves were conſtantly and duly made before the Sacrament, of how great Advantage would it be towards our Growth and Increaſe in Grace? By this Courſe we ſhould,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Diſcover whether we thrive in Grace or no; we ſhould evidently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whether it be better or worſe with us ſince our laſt appearing before the Lord at his Table.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We ſhould with Thankfulneſs acknowledg any further Degrees of Grace or Strength againſt Corruption that we have attained.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) We ſhould be humbled for our Backſlidings and Declinings after our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Engagements to the contrary, at our laſt partaking at the Table of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) We ſhould renew and ſtrengthen our Reſolutions againſt our Sins, and engage our ſelves to a more conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Performance of whatſoever Duties God requires of us.</p>
            <p>If any Man think there is ſmall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to be expected from ſuch a Courſe, he is certainly one who hath been little acquainted with it, or hath not obſerved it with Care and Conſtancy. Many of
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:61506:274"/>thoſe who come to that Ordinance, make no Conſcience at all of preparing them ſelves, but as 'tis to be feared, ouſh upon it inconſiderately and profanely. Others prepare themſelves out overly and careleſly; or if ſometimes they take more Pairs than ordinary in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and trying their Ways, and in other Parts of that Preparation which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for a due <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> God in that Ordinance, yet it is but very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that they are at this Bains. For the moſt part they ſuffer one thing or other to divert them, and take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> off from beſtowing time that way; and ſo the great Buſineſs of preparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being put off to the laſt, is but half done, or as good as wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Reflect and ask your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience how it hath been with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if you find this to have been your very Caſe, then never object that there is little Advantage from ſuch a Courſe, until you have practiſed it better and with more Conſtancy.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Buſineſs of the Text, the ſearching and trying of our Ways in time of any extraordinary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, perhaps, you have
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:61506:274"/>ſearched and done it with all the Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Diligence you could, and earneſtly implored God's Aſſiſtance therein; and this you have done often, and yet you cannot underſtand what particular Sin or Sins God aims at in the Afflictions which it hath pleaſed him to lay upon you. You diſcover Multitudes of Sins that you have been guilty of; but among them all to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern which they are which God at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent corrects you for above others, is that which by all your Enquiry you cannot attain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, It may ſo be, that you cannot ſingle out any one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sin; neither, it may be, did God ever intend it: He ſometimes by Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions intends to humble you for Sin in general; to correct your general Careleſneſs and Slackneſs in the whole Courſe of your Life; and to engage you to walk every way more ſtrictly and humbly before him.</p>
            <p>He intends alſo perhaps to mind you of old Sins which you have almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and to provoke you to renew your Repentance and Humiliation for them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore when at any time you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:61506:275"/>find out any particular Sin, for which above others God ſhould at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent have a Controverſy with you, fall upon Sin in the general, and improve your Affliction towards the attaining of greater Meaſures of Humiliation and Reformation: judg and humble your ſelf for old Sins as if they had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed; and let the Sight of all your other Sins lead you up to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Actual Sin, to your Original Corruption; and bewail that, and loath your ſelf for it.</p>
            <p>Moreover, you muſt remember, that God hath other Ends in afflicting his, beſides the chaſtening of them for Sin; he alſo by Afflictions tries, exerciſeth, and improveth Faith, Patience, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces. He by Afflictions ſtirs you up to Prayer, weans your Heart from the World, helps you the better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and ſavour Heavenly things, the Sweetneſs whereof you taſte not when you are glutted with outward Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If you be any way a Gainer by your Affliction, you have reaſon to take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort therein, and to be thankful.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the former Duty in time of Affliction, namely, the ſearching and trying of our Ways. I
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:61506:275"/>come now to the latter Duty, in thoſe Words. <hi>And let us turn unto the Lord:</hi> Of which I ſhall ſpeak briefly, becauſe I have in good part prevented my ſelf in what hath been ſpoken concerning the former Duty.</p>
            <p>From the manner of Expreſſion or Phraſe, of <hi>turning to the Lord,</hi> we learn the true Nature both of Sin and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Sin is an Averſion and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from God, and Repentance conſequently is a returning to him. This is manifeſt from the uſual Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Scriptures, which call Sin a forſaking God, a departing from God, a revolting from him, and the like. The Scriptures thus expreſſing Sin are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that I need not ſtand to mention them: And the Scriptures ſetting forth the Nature of Repentance by returning unto God, are as frequent. That the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sin lies in an Averſion from God, and Converſion to the Creature, will better appear if we deſcend to ſome particular Inſtances. Worldly Joy, what is it but a Joy in the Creature inſtead of the Creator, who is the proper Object of ſpiritual Joy? Carnal Confidence, what is it but a confiding in, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the Creature inſtead of God?
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:61506:276"/>And ſo 'tis no other than a leaving of God, to betake our ſelves to the Creature for thoſe Supplies and Aſſiſtances which we ſtand in need of. So the Prophet ſets forth the Nature of that Sin; <hi>Curſed be the Man that truſteth in Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 17.5.</note> 
               <hi>and maketh Fleſh his Arm, and whoſe Heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> And although this our departing from God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking our ſelves to the Creature, be not ſo apparent in divers other Sins, yet if we conſider the Matter throughly, we ſhall find the thing is ſtill the ſame: For in all Sin 'tis ſome kind of Profit or Pleaſure, or Content or Satisfaction in one kind or other, that we look after. Now we ſin when we ſeek theſe things in the Creature, turning aſide from God in whom there is moſt eminently what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Creature can afford us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Satisfaction, and infinitely more. Hence may be inferred ſeveral things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great Evil of Sin. In every Sin God is ſet at nought and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and the Creature is preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Yea the Creature is upon the matter made our God, while that Truſt and Confidence is put in it, that is only due to God; or that Satisfaction and
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:61506:276"/>Happineſs is expected from it, that is to be expected only from God. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The covetous Man is an Idolater,</hi> Eph. 5.5. becauſe he makes an Idol of his Riches, ſetting them up in the room of God, and making them the Object of his Truſt and Reliance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of God. The ſame is in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree done in every Sin, when a Man makes the Creature the Object of that Joy and Delight, of that Satisfaction and Complacency that he ought to take in God only. Now this is an high Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to God. What viler Indignity can be offered him, than that his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould be preferred before him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may hence alſo infer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Folly that there is in Sin; for therein we forſake the <hi>Fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Waters, and hew us out broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns that can hold no VVater,</hi> as God complains of his People, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.13. We forſake God in whom is all Fulneſs, and betake our ſelves to the Creature which is mere Vanity and Emptineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence alſo we may infer the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Goodneſs of God to us in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, the Deſign and End whereof is to reduce us from our Wandrings, and to bring us back again to God from
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:61506:277"/>whom we have gone aſtray; to recal us from following the ſmaller Streams and empty Rivulets of Diſſatisfaction and Vexation of Spirit, to the full and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Fountain of all true Bliſs and Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We may alſo hence infer, that the Duty of Repentance ought not to be ſo diſpleaſing and unacceptable to us as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually it is: For as ſowr and diſtaſteful a Work as it ſeems to be, 'tis but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to him who is the Well of Life, and a renewing our Acquaintance and Peace with him in whom our true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are lodged, in whoſe Favour is Life,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.3.</note> and <hi>whoſe Loving-kindneſs is better than Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo much of that Obſervation, from the Phraſe or manner of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which our true Repentance and Reformation are ſignified.</p>
            <p>Now that our Return unto God is the thing that God expects from us in our Afflictions, and which will aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the moſt effectual Means for removing God's afflicting Hand from us, I have already ſhewed in handling the former Duty. And all that I ſhall here add, ſhall be to ſhew very briefly, how we muſt return unto God, that his
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:61506:277"/>chaſtiſing Hand may be taken off from us, and by what Means we may be kept from leaving him again; and then anſwer one Objection that may be made againſt what ſhall have been ſpoken. Now as to the manner how we muſt return unto God if we will be freed from our Preſſures.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We muſt return ſpeedily. <hi>I thought on my VVays, and turned my Feet unto thy Teſtimonies: I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.59, 60. What through our Sluggiſhneſs, and what through our Unwillingneſs to forget our Sins, we are long a deliberating to return, and many Attempts and Eſſays we make at returning before we return indeed; and God in his Providence deals with us accordingly: he alſo ſeems to attempt to deliver us, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds no further becauſe we are ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and our Motions are ſo ſlow and inconſtant. Were our Returns to God ſpeedy, we might hope they would ſpeed our Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We muſt return thorowly. We many times take ſome Steps towards God, and having gone half way, we ſit down. Our Reformation is imperfect
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:61506:278"/>and partial.
<note place="margin">Hoſea 7.8.</note> We are like <hi>Ephraim, a Cake not turned;</hi> half Dough, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on one ſide only: and we fare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Though we have ſome Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, as God ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.7. yet God doth not go through with his Work, becauſe we go not through with our Work.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) We muſt return reſolutely and ſtedfaſtly, as I may ſo ſpeak; I mean with a reſolute, fixed and ſtedfaſt Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Heart, not to forſake God again, but to cleave unto him. When we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, God is moſt ready to entertain us, and be at Peace with us; but 'tis ever on condition that we <hi>turn not again unto Folly.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 85.8.</note> The Defect hereof was that which God complained of in his People; their <hi>Spirit was not ſtedfaſt with God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 78.8.</note> Their <hi>Goodneſs was as the Morning Cloud, and like the early Dew that goeth away.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſea 6.4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To prevent this our Return to Sin, and to enable us to cleave ſtedfaſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, (which was the ſecond thing) theſe things would be done.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You have found out and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken one Sin, but it may be you have not found out all: there may be other Sins not yet diſcovered, for which God's Hand is ſtill ſtretched out againſt you.

            <p n="2">2. It may be though you have for the preſent left your Sin, yet you have not left it out of a true Hatred of it, but only that you might be eaſed from the preſent Smart of your Affliction. God ſees that you ſtill retain an Affection for your Sin, and that though you have left it, yet you look back on it with a ſecret Deſire after it, as <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife look'd back upon <hi>Sodom.</hi>

            <p>THIS Chapter contains <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Addreſs unto God,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A Sermon preached the Day the Fire began at</hi> Northamp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton.</note> in which he confeſſeth and bewaileth the Sins of the Jews after their Return from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and more eſpecially their having joined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:61506:280"/>in Affinity with Strangers, and married Wives of thoſe idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about them, which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the Law of God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all ſuch Affinities and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. Now this their Sin was ſo much the greaten, and ſo much the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult an Undertaking it was to put a ſtop to it, upon a threefold Account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of the general ſpreading of this Sin among them, and the great Multitude of ſuch as had contracted this Guilt. We find, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.16, 17. that they who undertook the rolling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of this Reproach, and the reducing of the People to the Obſervation of the Law, were three full Months imployed in examining Offenders in this kind, and in taking Security from them that they would put away their unlawful Wives: Had not the number of them been very great, much leſs time would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for tranſacting that Buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard that they were not only the common, and the ordinary and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſort of People that had thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Law, but the Princes and the Rulers had been chief in this Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs: And the Prieſts and Levites,
<note place="margin">Ver. 2. Chap. 10.18, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> as well as the Princes, had been deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:61506:281"/>in this Guilt. Yea, ſo far had this Corruption prevailed among them, that there were found even of the Sons of <hi>Joſhua</hi> the Son of <hi>Jozadak</hi> the high Prieſt, that had taken ſtrange Wives, as in the ſame Place we are informed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard that ſome of them that were in this Treſpaſs, had been ſo long married to Strangers, that they had Children by them.
<note place="margin">Ver. 44.</note> In all theſe reſpects, I ſay, as their Sin was exceeding great, ſo it was a Buſineſs full of Difficulty to attempt the Reformation of a People in theſe Circumſtances, and ſo far ingaged in illegal Practices. But however <hi>Ezra</hi> being a Man full of Zeal for the Glory of God, and for the Good of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is not diſcouraged by all this. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Oppoſition that he was like to meet with in this hard Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he couragiouſly ſets about it, and through the Preſence of God with him, and the Bleſſing of God upon his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, he is ſucceſsful in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, and ſees a deſirable Iſſue thereof.</p>
            <p>You who have Opportunities put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Hands of doing any thing for God, and for the Good of the Place where God hath caſt your Lot, ſuffer not the Apprehenſion of Difficulties to
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:61506:281"/>diſmay you: Ariſe and be doing what lies in you, and leave the Succeſs to God;
<note place="margin">Zech. 4.7.</note> he that once ſaid, <hi>VVho art thou O great Mountain? before</hi> Zerubbabel <hi>thou ſhalt become a Plain;</hi> can go before you, and make the crooked Places ſtreight, and the rough Ways plain: he can moſt eaſily either remove all thoſe Difficulties that diſhearten you, or lift you above them: he often gives that Succeſs to zealous and ſincere Endeavours which not only anſwers, but far exceeds all our Deſires and Expectations. But then let's be ſure we take holy <hi>Ezra</hi> for our Pattern, and obſerve his Method. Being to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a great and difficult Buſineſs, he begins with Humiliation: he moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately confeſſeth, mourns over, and bewails the Sins of that People, the Reformation whereof he deſigned to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. The more deeply you can be affected with, and take to Heart the Sins, Diſorders, and Abuſes that you would remove; the more ſincerely, cordially and affectionately you can mourn over them, and lament them; the more Tears you can ſhed for them in your Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them before God, the better Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs may you hope your Endeavours of Reformation will be attended withal.
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:61506:282"/>How paſſionately did <hi>Ezra</hi> lay to Heart the Sins of that People? As ſoon as he had heard how they had by illegal Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities mingled themſelves with their idolatrous neighbouring Nations, how did he behave himſelf, and what deep Senſe of the Hainouſneſs of their Sin, and Greatneſs of their Provocation did he expreſs? <hi>VVhen I heard the thing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I rent my Garment, and my Mantle, and pluck'd off the Hair of my Head, and of my Beard, and ſat down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonied: And at the Evening-Sacrifice I aroſe up from my Heavineſs; and having rent my Garment, and my Mantle, I fell upon my Knees, and ſpread out my Hands unto the Lord my God, and ſaid, O my God, I am aſhamed, and bluſh to lift up my Face to thee, my God; for our Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are increaſed over our Head, and our Treſpaſs is grown up unto the Heavens.</hi> And then he goes on in the ſame Extaſy of Affection, laying open God's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Goodneſs to them, and the horrid Nature of their Provocation. And what's the Iſſue hereof, but ſuch a Reformation as a Man would wonder how it could ever be effected and brought about, conſidering how many the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders were, how great and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:61506:282"/>the Perſons of many of them were, and what ſtrong Temptations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements they had to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to abandon their Sin. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ezra</hi>'s ſtrange and almoſt unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled Humiliation, God was pleaſed to exert and put forth his Power in a ſtrange and extraordinary manner upon the Hearts of the Offenders, to prevail with them to diſclaim and renounce their Sin, notwithſtanding whatever carnal Motives and Conſiderations there were to endear it to them. If we could once attain to take Sin to Heart as he did, we might then expect to ſee better Fruits of our Endeavours after Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation than yet we can. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>In the Words that I have read, which are a part of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Addreſs unto God by humble and affectionate Confeſſion of their Sin, he ſpreads and lays open the Aggravations of it, together with the Danger and ſad Iſſues of it, if they ſhould ſtill continue in it. The Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations thereof are theſe three.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The great Severity that God had formerly ſhewed againſt them for their Sins, which is ſet forth and expreſs'd in the firſt Words; <hi>After all that is come
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:61506:283"/>upon us for our evil Deeds, and for our great Treſpaſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The merciful Tenderneſs and Compaſſion that God however even in that Severity was pleaſed to manifeſt towards them, in the next Words, <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou our God hast puniſhed us leſs than our Iniquities deſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The ſingular Favour God had ſhewed them in reſcuing them from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe Calamities which their Sins had brought upon them in the Clauſe following; <hi>And haſt given us ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance as this.</hi> Theſe were the things by which their Sin would be greatly heightned: after ſo much Severity, Compaſſion and Kindneſs, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Folly, and to have broken God's Commandments again, was to have done as bad as they could, as the Prophet ſpeaks, and to have given their Sins all the Aggravations that they were capable of.</p>
            <p>Then as for the Danger they expoſed themſelves to, that was no leſs than ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ruine and Deſtruction. After this Mixture of ſevere and merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, <hi>ſhould we again break thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments? wouldeſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadst conſumed us, ſo that
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:61506:283"/>there ſhould be no Remnant nor Eſcaping?</hi> They had indeed already broken God's Commandment in a grievous manner, and ſinned againſt him with an high Hand by thoſe unlawful Marriages. His meaning therefore is, ſhould we again break thy Commandment as we have done? Should we ſtill continue in our Sin, and obſtinately refuſe to be reduced to Obedience? If we ſhould ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly and irreclaimably go on in our Treſpaſſes, <hi>wouldeſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadst conſumed us?</hi> Of theſe Particulars in order as they lie in the Text.</p>
            <p>I begin with the Aggravations of their Sin, the firſt of which is the great Severity God had formerly ſhewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for their paſt Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil Deeds, and for our great Treſpaſs; ſhould we again break thy Commandments?</hi> Here divers things are obſervable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Ezra</hi> and all thoſe who join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him in this Confeſſion of their Sins, did endeavour to aggravate their Sins by calling in and laying together all thoſe Circumſtances by which the Hainouſneſs of them might the better appear. And this they did to the end
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:61506:284"/>their Hearts might be the more affected with them, and the more ſoundly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them; as alſo that they might be the more willing to forſake them. And this is the Property of all true Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, they ever deſire to be throughly apprehenſive of the Evil of their Sins; and therefore they aggravate them to the utmoſt; in their Confeſſions char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging themſelves fully with them, and laying as much Load upon themſelves as they can. They think they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpeak enough againſt themſelves, nor ſufficiently diſcover and repreſent the Evil of their Ways, inſomuch that ſometimes they rather exceed than come ſhort herein, charging themſelves more heavily than there was cauſe for.</p>
            <p>But Hypocrites, unhumbled and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners, are of a different tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; theſe inſtead of aggravating their Sins, are wont to extenuate and palliate them. If they be forced to confeſs them, 'tis for the moſt part but by halves that they do it. If they cannot but acknowledg they have offended, yet they will do it with an Apology, or with an Addition of ſomething that may qualify and leſſen their Sin: They are indeed ſometimes overtaken, but 'tis
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:61506:284"/>very rarely; 'tis when they are drawn aſide by ill Company, or overpower'd by the Strength of Temptation; that they are not the only Perſons that are faulty in that kind; that ſome others that would be eſteemed much better than themſelves, are much more blame-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; that there is no Man but muſt have his Allowances, and that it would go hard with us all if all our Actions ſhould be narrowly ſcanned; and the like. Theſe and ſuch like are the Excuſes which they plead, and the Defences they make for themſelves, when they ſhould take ſhame to themſelves, and own their Exceſſes and Exorbitances in their full Magnitude, judging themſelves that they might not be judged of the Lord. Theſe partial and favourable, lame and imperfect Confeſſions of Sin, when ſome little Part is owned, but much more is denied; when Fig-leaves and ſpecious Pretences are ſtudiouſly ſought out to cover as much of a Man's Shame as is poſſible, are ever an infallible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Sinner was never duly humbled for that Sin for which he hath ſtill ſo much Kindneſs and Affection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing obſervable is, that <hi>Ezra,</hi> and thoſe other holy Men, that
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:61506:285"/>together with him made this Confeſſion, did impute all thoſe Miſeries and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which they had ſuffered in the Captivity, unto their Sins: they did own their Sufferings as the Fruit of their Sins, and acknowledg their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions to have been the meritorious Cauſe and Procurers of their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>After all,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that is come upon us for our evil Deeds, and for our great Treſpaſs.</hi> They were convinced, and did yield and aſſent that God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in bringing thoſe Evils upon them, were to puniſh them for their Sins. This Conviction and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was neceſſary for them, and is for us all in reference to our Afflictions; and yet 'tis very difficult to attain it. 'Tis neceſſary, becauſe without it we can neither be patient under our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor profit by them, nor rationally expect a good Iſſue out of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Unleſs we be convinced that our Sufferings have relation to our Sins, and own them as the Fruits of our Sins, we ſhall hardly be able to undergo with Patience what is inflicted on us. To be ſure we ſhall want one of the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Arguments to work Patience in us. 'Tis the Senſe of our Sins deſerving
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:61506:285"/>whatſoever is come upon us, and an Acknowledgment of the righteous Hand of God in bringing ſuch Afflictions on us for our Sins, that humbles and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues our Hearts to God, compoſeth and quieteth our tumultuous Spirits, and gives check to all the Riſings of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Nature againſt God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It was the Senſe that <hi>Eli</hi> had of his own Guilt, and of the juſt Deſert of his own Sin, and the Sins of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that made him ſo patient, quiet and ſilent, when that heavy Sentence was by <hi>Samuel</hi> pronounced againſt him and his, as that he had not a Word to ſay more, than only to profeſs his humble and meek Submiſſion to the good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God; <hi>It is the Lord,</hi> ſaith he,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 3.18.</note> 
               <hi>let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> And this is that which the Spirit of God calls <hi>the accepting of the Puniſhment of our Sins.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 26.41.</note> But if the Sinner be not convinced that he ſuffers for his Sins, and that his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions have been the Procurers of his Afflictions, it cannot eaſily be but that his corrupt Nature ſhould rebel againſt God, and impatiently riſe up againſt his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as unequal, too rigorous &amp; ſevere.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. Neither can a Man profit by his Afflictions, unleſs he be convinced that
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:61506:286"/>his Sins have been the Cauſe of them, and that God ſtrikes at them in his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Who can think himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to amend and reform that, upon the account of his Afflictions, which he never diſcerned to be the Cauſe of them, nor can be convinced that they have any relation to it? But let a Man once be throughly apprehenſive of the Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God againſt him for his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sins, and ſee the Hand of God in his Afflictions ſtriking at thoſe Sins, and then he will ſoon think himſelf highly concerned to rectify or remove out of the way that which hath done him ſo much Miſchief: He will think he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make too much haſte to quit and be rid of that for which he ſorely ſmarts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and may yet ſmart more, unleſs by his ſpeedy Reformation he prevent it. When God had ſent a Plague among the Iſraelites for their murmuring, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> being deeply ſenſible of the fierce Wrath of God againſt them for that Sin, ſaith to <hi>Aaron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 16.46.</note> 
               <hi>Take a Cenſer, and put Fire therein from off the Altar, and put on Incenſe, and go quickly unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and make an Atonement for them; for there is Wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun. Go quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <pb n="555" facs="tcp:61506:286"/>ſaith he, <hi>for Wrath is gone out from the Lord.</hi> A lively Senſe of the Anger and Diſpleaſure of God in your Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for your Sins, will ſpeed and quicken your Endeavours to make your Peace with God, by anſwering the End of his Corrections.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Neither can you rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be freed from your Afflictions in a way of Mercy, until they bring you to the Sight of your Sins, and you look upon them as the Puniſhment of Sin: For till that be done upon you, your Afflictions are wholly fruitleſs, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done no part of that Work, for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of which God ſent them. To underſtand why you are afflicted, and to ſee the Sins which God ſtrikes at in your Afflictions, is the firſt Step towards God's attaining his End in afflicting you. If this be not done upon you, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done. And therefore you have no Reaſon to expect the Removal of them, unleſs it be to make way for ſome other more ſmarting Rod, which may effectually work that in you which God intended. But though in theſe Reſpects it be moſt neceſſary to ſee and own our Sins as the Cauſe and Procurers of our Sufferings, yet to do it is as difficult as
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:61506:287"/>'tis neceſſary. For ſuch is the Pride and Stubbornneſs of our Hearts, that we are not eaſily brought to take Shame to our ſelves, and to acknowledg our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sins to have been the Cauſe of our Sufferings, ſaying to our ſelves as God ſaith to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 4.18.</note> 
               <hi>Thy VVay and thy Doings have procured theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi> We are very unwilling to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg our own Guilt, and would much rather lay the Cauſe of our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings at any other Door than our own. And this we are eſpecially apt to do in publick and common Calamities. Theſe we aſcribe:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To Chance or common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in which we do not think our ſelves particularly touch'd or concern'd.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) To the Wickedneſs of ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and miſchievous Inſtruments, that were the Contrivers and Cauſers of our Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) To the Sins of others: The Provocations of ſuch and ſuch profligate and abominable Perſons drew down the Judgments of God upon the Place, and not our own Offences. As for our ſelves, we ſuffered only in the Croud, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we were found among thoſe who were to be puniſhed. Or,</p>
            <pb n="557" facs="tcp:61506:287"/>
            <p n="4">(4.) If we acknowledg our Sins in the general to have been the meritorious Cauſe of our Sufferings, yet we deſcend not to Particulars, we charge not our ſelves with ſuch and ſuch Sins for which God hath been angry with us. And ſo our owning our Sin only in general as the Cauſe of our Sufferings, is but a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal thing, with which we are little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. 'Tis little better than if we had ſaid, We believe indeed that we have deſerved all that is come upon us, but we know not how nor wherein. <hi>Ezra</hi> no doubt went a great deal further; 'tis not to be queſtioned but that he had in his moſt paſſionate Confeſſions, an Eye upon the particular Sins for which they ſuffered in <hi>Babylon.</hi> We may be ſure they were not Generalities only that ſo deeply affected him: he had upon his Heart the particular Inſtances of their vile Provocations, together with the Circumſtances of them; and ſo muſt we if we deſire to be affected with God's terrible Providences as we ought, and to take them to Heart in a right manner. Though what I am now ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all, yet there may be thoſe amongſt us who may think themſelves very little concerned therein.</p>
            <pb n="558" facs="tcp:61506:288"/>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe who though they have been Sufferers together with others, yet have been free from all thoſe foul and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Offences and high Provocations which many others have been guilty of; and poſſibly over and above their being free from the Guilt and Stain of fouler Sins, they have been ſuch as have made a ſtricter Profeſſion of Religion than moſt others. Theſe Perſons may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inclinable to think that God did not particularly intend the correcting of them for their Sins, in the common Judgment that lighted upon the Place, but that they ſuffer rather upon their Neighbours Account than their own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the ſame Opinion perhaps may they be tempted to be, who ſeem even as to outward things, to have gained by their Afflictions, and to be in a better Condition, as to Trade, than they were in before. 'Tis eaſy for ſuch, if any ſuch be, to entertain themſelves with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Dream, that God only emptied them to the end he might fill them ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than they were before; and that he had no other Deſign in pulling down their Houſes, than that he might build them up fairer. But let neither the one nor the other deceive themſelves. They
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:61506:288"/>would but flatter themſelves, if they ſhould think that God did not aim at their Sins in his ſevere Providences, as well as at the Sins of their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>As for the former of theſe, though they may have been free from the fouler Abominations and crying Sins of the Place; and though they may have made a ſtrict and high Profeſſion of Religion, yet even ſuch may have been tainted with the Pollution of many Sins which may have had no ſmall Influence in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the heavy Judgments of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Town. And their Sins, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their nearer relation to God, and ſtricter Profeſſion, may have reflected more Diſhonour upon the Name of God, than many of thoſe Sins in others, which have otherwiſe had much more Flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Enormity in them.</p>
            <p>And as for the latter ſort, who may ſeem to have gained by their Loſſes: If that be the Condition of any amongſt us, let them not be too forward thence to conclude their Innocency. God may pull down in Anger, and wound in higheſt Diſpleaſure; and yet ſuch is his admirable Goodneſs and Compaſſion, that he may anon repent him of the Evils which he hath for our Sins moſt
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:61506:289"/>juſtly brought upon us, and with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage rebuild what he had pulled down, and ſo fully heal the Wounds that he had made, as to leave us in a better Condition of Health and Strength than he found us in. God by the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel</hi> foretelling the Return of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in their own Land, promiſed to ſettle them after their <hi>old Eſtates, and to do better unto them than at their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 36.11.</note> Now what think you? Might they when God had made good this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, thence infer, that God was never angry with them for their Sins, and that their Sufferings in <hi>Babylon</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended as their Puniſhment? Their Caſe may be yours: God hath, it may be, ſince the Fire, dealt better with you than at the beginning; you are in ſome Reſpects perhaps in a better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than formerly, perhaps your Trade is doubled: Will you therefore now wipe your Mouths, and ſay you were innocent; you never offended God ſo as to have had any Hand in procuring his Judgments to be poured out upon this Place? Far be it from you to draw ſuch a proud Concluſion from God's gracious Providence towards you.
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:61506:289"/>Though God hath not only built you up again, but adorned and beautified you, and advanced you to a more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Condition than before, yet ceaſe not you ſtill to acknowledge and give glory to the righteous hand of God in pulling you down, and emptying you. Amid all your preſent Mercies and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, be you ſtill found putting your mouths in the duſt, loathing and abhorring your ſelves for your evil ways, and from your hearts profeſſing, That as you were moſt juſtly pluckt down, ſo you might ſtill as juſtly have lain in Ruins and Aſhes, and have been made perpetual Deſolations, as God once threatned the Land of the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 25.12.</note> a place never to be inhabited any more.</p>
            <p>And ſo much concerning the ſecond thing obſervable from this firſt aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſins.</p>
            <p>The Third Particular thence obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is, That to return to ſin after we have been ſeverely puniſhed for it, and grievouſly ſmarted for it, doth much heighten our ſin, and render it much more provoking in the ſight of God. This is clearly implied in the form of
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:61506:290"/>ſpeech which <hi>Ezra</hi> uſeth; <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſs, ſhould we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain break thy commandments?</hi> As if he had ſaid, This were a provocation of an high nature; far be it from any of us to be guilty of it.</p>
            <p>There are theſe three things that greaten and aggravate our ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt God; and notwithſtanding former great Severities againſt thoſe our ſins.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To ſin again in the ſame kind, after that we had grievouſly ſmarted for ſin, argues a great degree of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart. The ſcalled Child dreads the fire; and the very bruit Beaſts are afraid of medling with that for which they have been ſoundly beaten. And were there any tenderneſs upon the heart of man, he would not again eaſily be drawn to venture on that which he hath already paid ſo dearly for.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It argues an heart ſtrongly inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſin, and deſperately bent after it, which no former Severities will reſtrain, or hold in It ſhews a man is mad in love with ſin, that will out after it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſt him. 'Tis as much as if he ſaid, <q>'Tis true, I have already taſted
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:61506:290"/>of the bitter fruits of ſin; I can tell by experience what 'twill coſt me. But however, I muſt pleaſe my ſelf, I muſt gratify my ſinful deſires, my ſenſual and brutiſh Luſts, and I will, I am reſolved to do it, come what will of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It argues a ſlighting of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Diſpleaſure of the Almighty, and a contempt of his Rod. Herein a man's carriage towards God, is like that of a ſtubborn and incorrigible Child againſt him that chaſtens him. Though you make him ſmart, he cares not; correct him as long as you will, he is ſtill the ſame, and will do what he pleaſeth, do you what you will, or can, to reclaim him. Take heed of this ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of your ſins, you who have been Sufferers by the Fire, and all you who have any other way been ſeverely handled for your ſins. Beware how you have any more to do with thoſe ſins againſt which the fierce indignation of the Lord hath been ſo diſcovered, and his Word, as it were, revealed from Heaven. Keep at the greateſt diſtance from thoſe Sins; come not near the Borders or Confines of them; run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from all temptations to them.
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:61506:291"/>And that you may be preſerved from them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Labour to know what they be. 'Tis now a good while ſince the dreadful Fire; though you were then in a miſerable hurry, full of dread, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, and confuſions, ſo as you had ſcarce the command of your own thoughts; though then you had not ſo much ſedateneſs and compoſedneſs of ſpirit, nor ſo much freedom and liberty as to ſit down and conſider, as to reflect and enquire into your ſelf, as to call your ſelf to an account, and find out the cauſes of God's fierce Indignation, yet ſince you have had time enough to do it. Have you done it? Have you gotten a ſight of all thoſe your particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sins, by which the Wrath of God had been ſo highly incenſed againſt you? If you have not, if this work hath ſo long been neglected, if to this day you have never ſet about it; if ſtill you be ſtrangers to the reaſons of God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with you, yet be now at length perſuaded to make a narrow ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all thoſe Sins which have been the procurers of ſo much miſery to your ſelves, and this place.</p>
            <pb n="565" facs="tcp:61506:291"/>
            <p n="2">2. Having found out thoſe ſins, have them often in your thoughts; and if it be poſſible, carry always upon your heart the impreſſions of that terrible Judgment, at leaſt be ſure that you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call it to mind, and renew the lively remembrance of it, and labour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the images and repreſentations of all the diſmal circumſtances of it in your mind; and then ſay with <hi>Ezra</hi> here in the Text, <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſs, ſhall we again break thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> So ſay in reference to all your particular ſins; your filthineſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, your drunkenneſs and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your profanation of the Lord's Day and Ordinances, your pride and gallantry, your covetouſneſs and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, your unconſcionable dealing, and your diſhoneſt methods and artifices in the managing of your Trades and particular Callings; your ſcant Meaſures, and deceitful Ballances; your mingling, adulterating and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing your Commodities to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Buyer, and inhance your gain; your allowing your ſelves in diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lying, and falſhood, for your advantage; your laying aſide the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:61506:292"/>Rule of our Saviour, and making no conſcience of dealing with others, as you deſire to be dealt with your ſelves; your ſeeking your ſelves, and your own things, with the diſregard of your Neighbours, and the neglect of the Publick good; your lukewarmneſs, coldneſs and indifferency in the things that concern the glory of God, and the common and great intereſts of this place; your not uſing your power, and the authority you are entruſted and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, for the due puniſhment of ſin, and the beating down and ſuppreſſing of vice; your unequal and partial deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the adminiſtration of Juſtice; your mutual animoſities, variances, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings, emulations, and heart-burnings; I ſay, in reference to all theſe, ſo far as any of you may have been guilty of them, and in reference to all other ſins whatſoever which any of you may be convinced of as your own ſins by which you have contributed towards the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the late terrible Judgment of God upon this place; Say with <hi>Ezra</hi> in the Text, <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſs, ſhould we again break thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments?</hi> Should we again return to
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:61506:292"/>thoſe our ſinful practiſes that have laid this place in aſhes, and made it a ruinous heap? That have made it a by-word, and a Proverb, a gazing-ſtock, and an hiſſing, and an aſtoniſhment to all that paſs by, and that have cauſed the ears of all to tingle that have heard but the rumour and report of what the righteous hand of God hath brought upon us? O let's never think of taking up our former ſins, and cloſing with them again, after that God hath thus declared his anger againſt us for them, and by ſuch terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects of higheſt diſpleaſure, done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt whatſoever could be done to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter them to us, and diſingage us from them.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, to ſet our hearts at a greater remoteneſs from thoſe ſins, let's alſo make uſe of thoſe other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations which this Scripture affords us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Therefore though God hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely handled us, yet he <hi>hath in wrath remembred mercy, and puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve.</hi> If we take a true eſtimate of his dealings with us, we cannot chuſe but diſcern much leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and moderation, much tenderneſs and compaſſion to have been mingled
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:61506:293"/>with his ſeverity; and that in many reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He that turned your Houſes into aſhes and rubbiſh, and took away a great part of your ſubſtance, might have taken away all, and left you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He might by the ſame terrible Fire that deprived you of your Eſtate, have alſo deprived you of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and deareſt Relations. The loſs of one Child in ſuch a way of terrible Providence, would have troubled you more, and have gone nearer your heart than the loſs of all your Eſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It might have been your own lot to have periſhed in the flames. God that mercifully ſpared you, and reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you from the violence of the fire, might by it have hurried you out of this World into Hell, and ſent you from one fire to another. This fire was terrible, but the unquenchable fire of Hell had been much more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though you had eſcaped the fire, and been as a Brand pluckt out of the burning, yet ſuch impreſſions might the fright and danger you were in, have
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:61506:293"/>left upon you, that you might have loſt the uſe of your Reaſon, and have been as a Child, or Ideot, all your days.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God might have made ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of his Wrath upon your ſpirit by that terrible Judgment, as you might never have been rid of them, but have carried them to your Grave. You might have been not only a terror to your ſelf, but <hi>Magor Miſſabib, a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to all about you,</hi> as long as you had lived. How mercifully and favourably hath God treated you amid his greateſt Severities, ſeeing none of theſe things have befallen you, or any of yours! O then go one ſtep further with <hi>Ezra</hi> in the Text, and ſay, <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſs, and ſeeing thou haſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, ſhould we again break thy commandments?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. God was not only pleaſed to deal mercifully and compaſſionately with you in that heavy ſtroke, <hi>puniſhing you leſs than your iniquities deſerved; not ſtirring up all his wrath, nor ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe;</hi> but he hath alſo ſince been very gracious and
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:61506:294"/>favourable, kind and bountiful to you many ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Immediately upon that dreadful ſtroke, what rowlings of Bowels, and tender Compaſſions, did he cauſe in all the Countrey round about! What ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and plentiful Supplies in that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Seaſon, in that hour of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neceſſities, did God move the hearts of people to ſend you in from every quarter! Nobility, and Gentry, and Commonalty, Towns, and Villages in all the circuit round, ſtriving who ſhould do moſt for you, and whoſe Charity ſhould come moſt ſpeedily in for your preſent ſuccour and relief. What <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith of that ſignal night in which God brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 12.4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>It is a night much to be obſerved to the Lord, for bringing them out of the land of Egypt; this is that night of the Lord to be obſerved of all the children of Iſrael in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</hi> The ſame, or the like, may I ſay of that day of your diſtreſs, when God in ſuch a ſtrange manner touch'd the hearts of all ſorts of People with a tender ſenſe of your ſad and deplorable Condition, and ſo enlarged their hearts
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:61506:294"/>and hands towards you for your relief and ſupplies; 'tis a day much to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the Lord to give him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that mercy; 'tis that day which deſerves never to be forgotten by you, or yours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How kind and gracious was God to you in the mild and favourable Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſeaſon that followed, when many of the poorer ſort were even houſleſs and harbourleſs, and when generally the Fewel that People had laid in for the Winter, had been conſumed by the fire. What a gracious Providence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you was it, That when you had neither warm Houſes, nor proviſion of Fewel to defend you from the injuries of an hard Winter, the Weather ſhould be ſo mild and temperate as the like had ſeldom been known; and that through his goodneſs to you, you ſhould leſs need thoſe helps and defences againſt the cold which God had then depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you of! Should a ſevere and ſharp Winter have followed the Fire, it could ſcarce have been poſſible but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny muſt have periſhed before the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had been over.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What Aſſiſtances and large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions have you had throughout the
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:61506:295"/>Kingdom towards the recruiting of your Loſſes, and the re-building of the Town! Though ſome miſcarriages and loſs there may have been in managing the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and though all that you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, bears not that proportion to your Sufferings and Loſſes which ſome have conceived it did; yet, I believe, there was never any inſtance of any Town in <hi>England</hi> burnt, or ruined, for which ſo large Collections have been made. So exceedingly, and almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally throughout the Kingdom did God ſtir up, and open the hearts of people to commiſerate your Condition. God, <hi>who hath the hearts of all men in his hand, and turneth them as the rivers of water whitherſoever he pleaſeth,</hi> hath ſo toucht the hearts of Prince and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, City and Countrey, that all have contributed their aſſiſtances in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and eminent manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your reſtauration. And as for the King's favour and bounty towards you, it hath been very ſignal ſeveral ways; the Inſtances whereof are very well known, and muſt for ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, ſetting aſide <hi>London</hi> the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi> of the Kingdom, I think he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſo much for any diſtreſſed
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:61506:295"/>Town in his Dominions, as for this. In all which you muſt look to God, and acknowledge him as your great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Through the favour of God, and the great helps you have had from thoſe inſtruments of your good which he hath raiſed up, the Town is now in a fair way of being rebuilt, and of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and advanced to a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of luſtre and beauty, than ever it had before the fire: And moreover many of you, I hope, moſt of you, are in a good way of imployment, and livelihood, the Trade of the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to recover together with the Building.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It hath alſo pleaſed God to add another Bleſſing that ſweetens all your other Mercies, and gives you the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable enjoyment of them, and that is Health. There were great and juſt fears leſt the ſtraitneſs and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of poor Houſes, and narrow Rooms, into which, for want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Accommodations, ſeveral Families were ſometimes enforced to crowd, might have occaſioned ſome Epidemical Diſeaſe in the Town; but in this alſo the wonderful goodneſs of God to the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:61506:296"/>Town hath appeared, there having hardly ever been known ſo long a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo much health in the Town as ſince the Fire.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is yet one thing more that crowns all your Mercies, and that is, That God affords you his Goſpel; a Mercy, which of it ſelf alone were enough to make you ample amends for all your Sufferings, though God ſhould ſtrip you of all other Comforts, <hi>and give you only the bread of adverſity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 30.20.</note> 
               <hi>and the water of affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, God having done all this for you; having raiſed you out of the duſt, and ſet you upon your feet once more, and loaded you with ſo many Favours; what remains but that now you add what <hi>Ezra</hi> further adds in the Text, and ſay full out with him, <hi>After all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great treſpaſs;</hi> ſeeing thou our God haſt puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities deſerve, and haſt given us ſuch a deliverance as this, <hi>ſhould we again break thy commandments? Wouldeſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed us, ſo that there ſhould be no remnant, nor eſcaping?</hi> I beſeech you
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:61506:296"/>let us all labour to ſay ſo from our very hearts, and with the ſame holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt our ſins, and ſtrength of reſolution to forſake them, as he did; and then he that hath begun to do us good, and carried on his work of mercy thus far, will no doubt perfect it to his own glory, and our comfort.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing our danger is ſo great, if we return to our folly after ſuch terrible Judgments, and ſignal Mercies, give me leave to caution you againſt ſome of thoſe ſins which we are moſt in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Now that your Town begins to riſe again with greater beauty and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, take heed of being lifted up. <hi>Be not high-minded, but fear,</hi> leſt for your ſins God lay you low, and level you with the ground once more. You know what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Prov. 16 18.</note> 
               <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction, and an haughty ſpirit before a fall.</hi> The odious ſin of Pride hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been imputed to this place. And doth it not begin to bud again, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>notwithſtanding all that God hath done to humble us?</hi> If it do not, what means our apparrelling our ſelves above our rank and quality? what
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:61506:297"/>means our forwardneſs to come as near as we can to every vain Faſhion, and immodeſt Dreſs, which our looſe times have taken up? How is it that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not content our ſelves with ſuch comely Apparrel, and modeſt Dreſſes, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a People that have not long ſince been among the pots, and lain in the aſhes; and whereby we might be Patterns of modeſty and ſobriety to others?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed of making too much haſte to recover and repair your Loſſes by any unlawful Artifices, or unjuſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Methods of gain. <hi>Solomon</hi> again hath taught us,
<note place="margin">Prov. 28.20.</note> 
               <hi>That he who maketh haſt to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Take heed of ſetting unreaſonable Prizes upon your Commodities. Do not ſo far deceive your ſelves, as to think your Loſſes now juſtify you in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Rates you pleaſe. That were a very ill uſe of that heavy Judgment that hath been upon you. Content your ſelves with moderate gain; ſo ſhall you riſe again more ſurely, though more ſlowly.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Take heed of dealing hardly with the Poor, and oppreſſing them in thoſe
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:61506:297"/>ways in which you make uſe of them. Let them have what is fit, and pay them well for their labour. Though your own gain for the preſent may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the leſs, yet both your Comfort and the Bleſſing of God upon what you have, will be ſo much the greater. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think your ſelf a loſer by uſing a poor man well, and giving him with the moſt, rather than with the leaſt, for the ſervice he doth you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for you, whoſe Calling lies in giving entertainment to others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed that you for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage make not your ſelves partakers of other mens ſins, by entertaining idle and intemperate perſons at unſeaſonable hours, or by giving them more drink than is fit. This were the ready way to debauch the Town, and draw upon you the Curſes of thoſe Families that may be ready to ſtarve at home, while bad Husbands loſe their time, and miſpend their Money in your Houſes, by which their Relations ſhould be ſupported. Can you think that what is thus gained, will ever proſper with you? Would it not bring the Curſe of God upon all that you have?</p>
            <pb n="578" facs="tcp:61506:298"/>
            <p n="2">2. Above all, take heed of making your Houſes, the harbour and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz of leud and filthy Perſons. Hath God for the ſins of <hi>Sodom</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the Judgment of <hi>Sodom</hi> upon you; and dare any ſet up, and carry on the ſame trade again in contempt of God, and in open defiance of his Judgments? If ſuch impudent and daring Sinners ſhould be ſtill found amongſt us, it were enough to ſet the Town on a light flame once more. Let ſuch perſons tremble to think what awaits them, if nothing will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Be you all in general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to lay aſide your mutual Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities and Contentions, which have been, and ſtill are, the great reproach of this place; <hi>Be kindly affectionate one towards another, with brotherly love,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> exhorts. <hi>Be all of one mind, ſtudy peace, and the things that make for peace.

               </note> brought them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and once more ſettled them in the Promiſed Land, they for a time wholly minded their own private Intereſts and Concernments; but the publick Worſhip of God, as if that had
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:61506:299"/>been no man's concern, was no man's care. The ſettling of their own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the building and beautifying of their own Houſes ſo took them up, that the building of the Houſe of God was little regarded. It was long before this work was begun; and after it was begun, and ſome progreſs had been made therein, it met with ſeveral diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and interruptions, and went on very ſlowly, as for the moſt part Church-work doth. Two great obſtructions there were that did not a little retard and ſet back this work, the one from without, the other from within.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Enemies from without, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no endeavours, left no Stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, whereby they might hinder the building of the Temple. And what by their own Power, what by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, they ſo far prevailed as to put divers ſtops to the work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The obſtruction from within, was their lukewarmneſs and indifferency, their want of Zeal and forwardneſs for promoting and carrying on the work. Now as well for their encouragement againſt the Enemy, as for rouſing them
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:61506:299"/>up and exciting them to more Zeal and Activity in promoting a work in which the honour of God and the happineſs of that people were ſo much concerned, God was pleaſed to raiſe up and imploy two extraordinary Perſons, the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Zechary.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> having reproved them for their ſlackneſs and negligence, for their minding their own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Affairs with the neglect of what referred to the honour and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip of God; and having laid before them the ſeveral Judgments which for this their Sin God had inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, doth aſſure them of God's gracious preſence, aſſiſtance, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in this weighty undertaking, if they ſhould in good earneſt engage therein, and purſue it with that Zeal, Vigour, and Induſtry, which in the managing and carrying on of ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant an Affair was requiſite. Now to the end that all objections againſt it might be anſwered, and whatſoever was or could be matter of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be removed, the Prophet in the words that I have read, doth meet with the principal things which carnal Reaſon might pitch upon, and
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:61506:300"/>make uſe of for the cooling of their Zeal, the rebating of their Induſtry, and the ſlackning of their Endeavours. Were the Adverſaries and Oppoſers of this work numerous and potent? How many and how potent ſoever they were, the Lord of Hoſts would be with his People, and ſtand by them. He would exert and put forth his Almighty Power in the behalf of them; he would ſhake the Heavens, and the Earth, and the Sea, and the dry Land. He would make all things give way to, yield, and ſtoop to his deſign; and rather than any thing ſhould hinder the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of what he had undertaken to do for his People, he would turn the World upſide down. Now upon their late return from Seventy years Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Babylon,</hi> was their outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſtrait, poor and low? Were they altogether unfurniſhed with thoſe rich ſupplies which were neceſſary for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on ſo coſtly a work? That this might not trouble or diſhearten them, God tells them the Silver is his, and the Gold is his. He had all the Riches of the World at command, and could plentifully furniſh and ſupply them, if he ſaw good. Now that the platform
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:61506:300"/>of the Houſe was drawn out, and the Foundations of it were laid, did the meanneſs of it diſcourage rhem? Did it ſeem a poor and contemptible thing in compariſon of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple? How mean and deſpicable ſoever it might be in the eyes of any of them, and how far ſhort ſoever it was likely to be of the Splendor and Magnificence of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, yet God promiſeth to fill that Houſe with Glory, and that the Glory of that latter Houſe ſhould be greater than the Glory of the former. Were the frequent commotions and changes of the World, and the inconſtant and variable ſtate of things in thoſe parts of the World ſuch as promiſed them little quiet and ſatisfaction in the enjoyment of God's publick worſhip when the Temple ſhould be finiſhed? For allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe their fears, as the cloſe of all that God had promiſed, he tells them, that he would give peace in that place. And in regard that theſe were great things, and ſuch as an oppreſſed people that had been long under hatches, and had but of late begun to put up their Heads, could not eaſily belive; God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth his Omnipotency and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the performance of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:61506:301"/>the compaſs of four verſes five times repeating that ſolemn form of words, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I have given you the main Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Scope of theſe words. In the handling of them, I muſt take them in order as they lye. And becauſe there are many things contained in them, which might take up ſome Hours if they were treated of at large, I muſt with all convenient brevity ſpeak to Particulars, and paſs on from one thing to another as lightly and ſpeedily as I can. But as I go on, where the matter will admit of it, and as far as it ſhall be capable thereof, I ſhall endeavour to bring it as near the preſent occaſion as I may.</p>
            <p>Though the words will ſcarce admit of any genuine, proper, and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diviſion, yet ſuch a diviſion as they are capable of, you may thus take.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have a prediction of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions and ſhakings in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of the Meſſiah: <hi>Yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens, and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land, and will ſhake all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="585" facs="tcp:61506:301"/>
            <p n="2">2. We have a Prediction of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>And the deſire of all nations ſhall come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A Promiſe of the Glory of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, together with an anſwer to an objection againſt it: <hi>And I will fill this houſe with glory: the ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. An Amplification of that Promiſe concerning the glory of the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater than the glory of the former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. An additional Promiſe of Peace, as an Appendix to all other Mercies promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: <hi>And in this place will I give peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The Ratification or Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole, in thoſe laſt words, <hi>ſaith the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, and with which all that was before promiſed, is at laſt ſhut up and ſealed.</p>
            <p>To begin with the firſt of theſe, the Prediction of great concuſſions and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings in the World before the coming of the Meſſiah; <hi>It is yet a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens, and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land, and will ſhake all nations.</hi> By theſe Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expreſſions, according to the uſual
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:61506:302"/>Language and Style of the Prophets, we are to underſtand great Troubles, Commotions, Changes and Alterations in the World, in which high and low, Perſons of all Conditions, Ranks and Qualities, repreſented by the Heavens and the Earth, ſhould take their turns, and have their ſhare. So God ſpeaking of his terrible Judgments on the World, ſaith,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 13.13.</note> 
               <hi>I will ſhake the heavens, and the earth ſhall remove out of its place in the wrath of the Lord of Hoſts, and in the day of his fierce anger.</hi> But now all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is, what ſhakings ſhould be here intended. Some underſtand the words of the great things which the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts report to have been done at and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Birth of Chriſt, the Miracles wrought by him in his Life, the ſtrange and miraculous Providences at his Death and Reſurrection; and of the ſhaking of the World afterwards by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, whereby Idols were thrown down, Heatheniſh Idolatry and Superſtitions were aboliſhed; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and the Worſhip of the true God coming in place thereof. Theſe were great and wonderful things; but how they ſhould be here by the Prophet intended, is not eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:61506:302"/>For he ſeems to ſpeak of ſuch concuſſions and ſhakings as ſhould be antecedent to the coming of Chriſt, and go before it, not concur with it, much leſs follow after it. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, I will ſhake the heavens, and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land: and I will ſhake all nations, and the Deſire of all nations ſhall come;</hi> that is, after God ſhould thus have ſhaken the World, Chriſt ſhould come. And indeed very great and dreadful ſhakings there were between the time of this Prophecy, and the coming of the Meſſiah; in which ſhakings the people of God, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, were not a little concern'd. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, under which they now were, was not only ſhaken, but ſhaken in pieces, diſſolved and ruined by the <hi>Grecians</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Alexander the Great.</hi> Then preſently after <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death, who died in the flower of his Age, the Empire which he had but juſt then acquired and been poſſeſſed of, was in effect once more rent in pieces, and divided amongſt his Chieftains and Principal Commanders. While this ſtate of things continued, the <hi>Jews</hi> were miſerably ſhaken, oppreſſed, and haraſſed by the
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:61506:303"/>Tyranny and Cruelty of <hi>Antiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> beſides many other grievous preſſures and ſufferings, which during the Government of the <hi>Seleucides</hi> they underwent. After ſome time the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> came upon them all, and ſubdued all to themſelves; in which Revolution the diſtreſſed <hi>Jews</hi> fell under the power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and were at their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. After all theſe terrible ſhakings, nearer the coming of Chriſt, the Civil Wars under <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> cauſed hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſhakings and convulſions in the Empire; after which the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> was ſhut up, and a peaceable time enſued, all Swords being ſheathed, and all Arms laid aſide throughout the whole Empire; and then was Chriſt the Prince of Peace born in the Forty firſt, or as ſome will have it, in the Forty ſecond year of the Reign of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whereas all theſe ſhakings were to go before the coming of Chriſt, which was the greateſt Mercy that ever was vouchſafed the World, we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>That great Troubles and Afflictions ſometimes go before and make way for great and ſignal Mercies. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:61506:303"/>the ordinary and uſual method of God's moſt wiſe and gracious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> is ſold to the <hi>Midianites,</hi> carried into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there again ſold to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> falſly accuſed, caſt into Priſon, and laid in Irons, that by this Series of long-continued Afflictions way might be made for his Advancement to the higheſt Honour in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court, and for his being made Ruler over all the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſeventy years Captivity and Bondage in <hi>Babylon</hi> goes before the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and triumphant Return of God's people into their own Land, of which the Pſalmiſt thus ſpeaks,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 126.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>When the Lord turned the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream: then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging: then ſaid they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.</hi> Which <hi>Pſalm,</hi> though placed among the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> yet is by Learned men, upon good grounds, ſuppoſed to have been penned by ſome other Perſon after the return from <hi>Babylon;</hi> as alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. that is to ſay, 460 years at leaſt after that <hi>David</hi> had been gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Fathers; and perhaps much
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:61506:304"/>more, for we know not how long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the return from <hi>Babylon</hi> it might be penned.</p>
            <p>Thus the Ten moſt Cruel and Bloody Perſecutions of the Chriſtian Church in the firſt Ages thereof, went before that quiet and tranquillity which the Church enjoyed under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Chriſtian Emperors, when, to uſe the expreſſions of the Prophet, <hi>God made the peace of his Church as a river, and the righteouſneſs thereof as the waves of the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus that wicked Uſurpation and Tyranny of Antichriſt, making havock of the Church, which hath been drawn out to ſo great a length already, and yet we know not how much longer it may laſt, goes before that happy eſtate of the Church, and of the World, when thoſe joyful Acclamations ſhall be heard, <hi>The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 11.15. And when they who ſhall have gotten <hi>the victory over the beaſt and over his image, ſhall ſing the ſong of Moſes and of the Lamb, ſaying, Great and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy ways, thou king of ſaints,</hi> Rev. 15.1, 2. And to add but
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:61506:304"/>one inſtance more here at home; thus after the ſharp and bitter Perſecutions under the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that bleſſed Sunſhine of the Goſpel, and the peaceable and undiſturbed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment thereof throughout all the long and proſperous, or rather glorious Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it to us ever ſince, even to this day, notwithſtanding all the deſtructive Machinations, wicked Plots, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Attempts of the Enemy to deprive us of it, and to put out our light in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Now ſome of the reaſons of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Divine Providence are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It conduceth very much to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing and illuſtrating of the glory of God's Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs, who can ſo wonderfully change the moſt dark and diſmal ſtate of things, <hi>who creates darkneſs, and forms light,</hi> Iſa. 45.7. <hi>Who turns the ſhadow of death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the morning,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.8. Who turns a Town into Aſhes and Rubbiſh in the ſpace of few Hours, making it a place meet for <hi>Zim</hi> and <hi>Okim</hi> to take up their abode in the mercileſs Element where it raged ſcarce
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:61506:305"/>leaving a Lintel for the Cormorant or Bittern to lodge in, or the remainders of a ſcorched Window to ſing in: And then again within the ſpace of few years, out of the Duſt and Aſhes to raiſe up a Town for the Accommodation of men, and a Church for the Service of God, and both with the addition of that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and luſtre which had never been, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God had laid the Foundations of that change for the better in ruin and deſolation. All Beholders muſt needs acknowledge ſuch admirable turns and viciſſitudes of things, to be the operation of his Hands, who is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in counſel, and excellent in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By dark Providences, by Troubles and Afflictions, God fits and prepares us for Mercies. Our Afflictions when ſanctified, humble us, lay us low, make us reflect upon our ſelves, and conſider our ways; make us repent, reform, and turn to him that ſmiteth us; and all this tends to the rendring us meet to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Mercies which God hath in ſtore for us. For while we go on impenitently in a courſe of Sin, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings would be curſed to us, and abuſe of Mercies would increaſe our miſery.</p>
            <pb n="593" facs="tcp:61506:305"/>
            <p n="3">3. Afflictions commend God's after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercies, and make them more ſweet and acceptable to us, as the darkneſs of the Night commends the light of the Morning. A quiet and calm Seaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Storm, how welcome, how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightſome is it! Such is the unſpeakable goodneſs of God, that he ſo much conſults our comfort, as to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſpoſe of the circumſtances of our Mercies, ſo as they may afford us moſt content and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Great Troubles and Afflictions going before great Mercies, diſpoſe our Hearts to greater thankfulneſs for them. When Mercies come in upon us in ſuch a ſeaſon, and with ſuch circumſtances, they greatly affect us, and make deep impreſſions on our Hearts, ſo as we think we can never be thankful enough, we can never bleſs God ſufficiently for them.</p>
            <p>Now to apply this briefly; The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of what hath been ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this method of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the Reaſons of it, ſhould perſwade us, and prevail with us to bear Afflictions meekly, quietly, and patiently, and with that compoſedneſs,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:61506:306"/>calmneſs, and evenneſs of Spirit which becomes Chriſtians, who are no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the uſual ways of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, neither fretting againſt the Lord, nor deſponding, or caſting away our confidence in him. Though it be night with you at preſent, yet you may hope it will not be ſo always, the day will return. There is an interchangeable viciſſitude of theſe Providences; after darkneſs light breaks forth, and the longer your night hath been, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are the approaches of the day; wherefore in the moſt dark and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate condition ſay with the Church of God,
<note place="margin">Mic. 7.7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice not againſt me, O mine enemy, when I fall, I ſhall ariſe; when I ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Lord ſhall be a light unto me. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſinned againſt him, until he plead my cauſe, and execute judgment for me; he will bring me forth to the light, and I ſhall behold his righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I have done with the firſt thing, the Prediction of great concuſſions and ſhakings in the World before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Meſſiah.</p>
            <pb n="595" facs="tcp:61506:306"/>
            <p n="2">2. I come now to the ſecond Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, The Promiſe of his coming, <hi>And the deſire of all nations ſhall come.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of all Nations, that is Chriſt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the deſire of all Nations, or whom all Nations ſhall deſire. But then this muſt be underſtood of ſome of all Nations, of as many out of all Nations as are diſpoſed to receive him; though others, perhaps the generality of ſome Nations, may be ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him, that they may hate him, blaſpheme his Name, and perſecute to the Death all that acknowledge him for their Saviour. But if this ſenſe be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too ſtrait, then by the deſire of all Nations we may underſtand the deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of all Nations, or he who hath that in him which ſhould render him lovely and deſirable to all Nations, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect whereof all Nations may and ſhould deſire him; and ſo far as they know him, and underſtand their own intereſt, will deſire him. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription or character of Chriſt is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to what the Scriptures elſewhere ſay concerning him.

That is, all People and Nations out of an high eſteem of him, and an earneſt deſire after him, ſhall flow in to him. So God ſpeaking of the coming in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Church in the Times of the Goſpel, and under the Kingdom of the Meſſiah, ſaith, <hi>Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and ſet up my ſtandard to the people, and they ſhall bring thy ſons in their arms, and thy daughters ſhall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon their ſhoulders,</hi> Iſa. 49.22. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a root of Jeſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſhall ſtand for an enſign to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek,</hi> Iſa. 11.10. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, mine elect in whom my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth; I have put my ſpirit upon him, he ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. I will give him for a Covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles,</hi> Iſa. 42.1. <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Iſrael; I will alſo give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:61506:307"/>my ſalvation to the ends of the earth,</hi> Iſa. 49.6. Hence it is that the Church ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of all Nations, is repreſented to St. <hi>John</hi> in a Viſion as giving glory to Chriſt. <hi>I beheld,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and lo a great multitude which no man could num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, of all nations, and kindreds, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and tongues, ſtood before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their hands, and cryed with a loud voice, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Salvation to our God which ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 7.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Now if you ask in what reſpects, and upon what account Chriſt is the deſire of all Nations? I anſwer, this is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which would take up much time if I ſhould enlarge on it. Briefly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is the deſire of all Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the promiſed <hi>ſeed in whom all the nations of the earth were to be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 22.18. Becauſe he is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of all Nations, <hi>the ſaviour of the w rld,</hi> John 4.42. <hi>The propitiation for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> 1 John 2.2. <hi>There being no other name under heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> Acts 4.12. In ſhort, he it is that ſatisfieth the Juſtice of God for Sinners, and delivers them from the wrath to
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:61506:308"/>come, that purchaſeth for them pardon of ſin, peace with God, Grace here, and Glory hereafter. In a word, this is he <hi>who is of God made unto us wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. Now let us all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our ſelves, and conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he who is the deſire of all Nations, be the deſire of our Souls; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in our eſteem the chiefeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ten thouſand. Do we <hi>count all things loſs and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt?</hi> Do we intirely love him? Do we earneſtly long after him? Are our Affections towards him ſuch as we can never be ſatisfied until we can ſay that he is ours, and we are his? Could we be content to purchaſe him at any rate? And is there nothing in all the World ſo dear unto us, but that we could freely part with it for his ſake? O let us never be at reſt until we find that our Hearts ſtand thus affected towards him. What ſay you to this, all ye that have the Name of Chriſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in your Mouths, and by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Profeſſion own him as your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but ſay of him in your Hearts, <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us?</hi> Ye that give him good words, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:61506:308"/>to take his Yoke upon you, and ſubmit to his Government; who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs you know him, love him, deſire him, and give him the chief room in your Hearts, but in your works deny him, being abominable, diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate Deceive not your ſelves, Chriſt will never own ſuch as you are. Without timely and ſincere Repentance, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which you muſt expect from him is, <hi>Depart from me, ye that work iniquity, I never knew you,</hi> Mat. 7.23.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the Character of Chriſt. Now as to the Promiſe of his coming; all that I ſhall therein take notice of, is the circumſtance of time, when he was to come, namely, while the ſecond Temple ſhould be yet ſtanding; for he was by his preſence to fill that Houſe with Glory, and to make the Glory of the latter Houſe greater than that of the former, as we ſhall preſently ſee. And this circumſtance of his coming, is that which alſo the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> who propheſied immediately before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, foretold. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Meſſiah himſelf, <hi>I ſend my meſſenger,</hi> (that is, <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> the forerunner of
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:61506:309"/>Chriſt) <hi>and he ſhall prepare the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; and the Lord whom ye ſeek</hi> (namely the Lord Chriſt) <hi>ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly come to his temple,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mal. 3.1.</note> 
               <hi>even the meſſenger of the Covenant whom ye delight in.</hi> This, as it confutes the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blaſphemous <hi>Jews,</hi> and argues the wilful blindneſs of their minds, and the miſerable obſtinacy and hardneſs of their hearts in denying the Meſſiah to be come, and ſtill fixing new periods of time for his coming, as they find ſtill that he comes not at the times by them aſſigned him for his coming; ſo it greatly confirms our Faith in Chriſt as the true Meſſiah. For as all other things propheſied and foretold concerning the Meſſiah exactly agree to him and none elſe; ſo doth this remarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the time of his coming.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent his Son into the world, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law,</hi> Gal. 4.4, 5. <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come,</hi> that is, when the time which God had predetermined and foretold was fully come. This is that which <hi>Jacob</hi> propheſied of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The ſcepter ſhall not depart from
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:61506:309"/>Judah; nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come.</hi> Though the <hi>Jews</hi> had now ever ſince the Conqueſt of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> by <hi>Pompey,</hi> been under the Power of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and by them been depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all power to judge, determine, and puniſh in Capital Matters; yet in other matters they had ſtill a power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, ſo as all Government was not wholly wreſted away from them, and taken out of their hands. But now the time was drawing near when their City and Temple were to be utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; their Polity, Civil State, and Commonwealth to be aboliſhed, the remainders of them, after the fatal ſlaughters of that miſerable people at the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and ſcattered into ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, and not as much as the face or ſhadow of any Government to be left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. At this ſignal and critical time, when the day of theſe their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities haſtened, was Chriſt born. The ſum of all is this, The Meſſiah was to come while the ſecond Temple was yet ſtanding, and while the Scepter was not yet wholly departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> nor a Lawgiver from between his feet; while at leaſt ſomewhat of Civil Power and Government ſtill remain'd among them;
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:61506:310"/>and ſo accordingly he came. But 'tis now above ſixteen hundred years ſince the Temple was deſtroyed, and all Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among them, into what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World ſoever ſcattered, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly aboliſhed. In vain therefore do the <hi>Jews</hi> expect any other Meſſiah; and as for us Chriſtians, we have all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable evidence that Jeſus, the Son of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is the Chriſt, the promiſed Meſſiah. To him therefore let us betake our ſelves for the pardon of our Sins, and the ſalvation of our Souls; on him let us reſt, to him let us ſecurely commit the Everlaſting Concernments of our Souls. <hi>Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.1. <hi>If an angel from heaven preach any other goſpel,</hi> take upon him to hold forth any other Meſſiah, or to declare any other way of ſalvation, <hi>let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Now follows the third Particular, A Promiſe of the glory of the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, together with the anſwer of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt it; <hi>I will fill this houſe with glory; the ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine. I will fill this houſe with glory,</hi> that's the Promiſe. In which words there ſeems to be a double Alluſion; partly an Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the external glory of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:61506:310"/>Temple that was ſo magnificently built, and ſo richly beautified and adorned; and partly to the glorious appearance of God in that Temple, at the dedication thereof, concerning which we read, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.10, 11. <hi>That a cloud filled the houſe of the Lord, ſo that the prieſts could not ſtand to miniſter becauſe of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord had filled the houſe.</hi> So then, as the firſt Temple was filled with glory, ſo God promiſed the ſecond ſhould alſo be. But now what glory is here meant, and how this Promiſe was fulfilled, I ſhall preſently ſhew when I come to ſpeak of the Amplification of the Promiſe. For the preſent it is enough to know that God undertakes it, who can do whatſoever he pleaſeth, and will do whatſoever he hath promiſed. But however carnal reaſon objects, How can theſe things be? Where is the Silver and the Gold? Where are the rich materials wherewith this Houſe ſhall be ſo ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly rebuilt? To this tacit objection that might be in the minds of that oppreſſed and indigent people, God anſwers, <hi>The ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine.</hi> As if he had ſaid, If I undertake to fill this Houſe with glory, make you no queſtion but that I ſhall find means for effecting it.</p>
            <p>And was there not a time when
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:61506:311"/>the objection of this people was, or might have been ours? He that had ſeen this Town, and the place in which now we are aſſembled, the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the dreadful Fire, would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of living to ſee it rebuilt as now it is; he would rather have thought that the ſentence pronounced againſt <hi>Moab</hi> had belonged to it, that it ſhould be for <hi>the breeding of nettles and ſalt-pits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zeph. 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>and a perpetual deſolation.</hi> If there had been any Prophet then among us that could have ſaid, Out of theſe Aſhes and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous heaps ſhall a Town and a Church be raiſed within the ſpace of a few years, and you ſhall ſee it more beautiful and ſplendid than ever it was before the Fire, the reply would have been, Where is the Silver, and where is the Gold wherewith it ſhall be done? Whence ſhall the diſtreſſed and impoveriſhed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have wherewithal to compaſs it? But bleſſed be God, who hath found out means, and afforded helps to bring it to paſs. He who ſaith, <hi>The ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine;</hi> he who hath the <hi>treaſures of darkneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 45.3.</note> 
               <hi>and the hidden riches of ſecret places at his diſpoſal,</hi> as he ſpeaks, hath inclined the Hearts of Prince and People, of Nobility and Gentry, of City and Country, to lend their aſſiſtance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:61506:311"/>it in ſuch a full ſtream of bounty, as ſcarce admits of any parallel. But to the King's Bounty and Munificence do we in a more eminent and ſingular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner under God owe the Rebuilding of the Town and the Church, and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the Church, which as long as it continues in being, will be a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monument thereof. As we muſt with all thankfulneſs acknowledge our deep obligations to all from the higheſt to the loweſt that have been Inſtruments of our good, and particularly to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, the Commiſſioners, by whoſe care and induſtry this place for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip and Service of God hath at length been perfected; ſo muſt we give God all the glory, who ſets all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments a work, who hath the hearts of all men in his hand as the <hi>rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and turneth them whither ſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. So I go on to the fourth Particular, the Amplification of the Promiſe; <hi>And the glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater than the glory of the former.</hi> If theſe words ſhould be underſtood of outward glory, it would be hard to ſhew how
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:61506:312"/>the Promiſe was fulfilled. We read that when the Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezr. 3.12.</note> and the chief of the Fathers, who were ancient men that had ſeen the former Houſe, ſaw the Foundation of the ſecond Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple laid before their eyes, they wept with a loud voice, conſidering how ſhort the latter Houſe came of the former. <hi>Who is there among you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hag 2.3.</note> ſaid the Lord, <hi>that ſaw this houſe in her firſt glory? And how do you ſee it now? Is it not in your eyes in compariſon of it as nothing?</hi> So then clear it is, that <hi>Zerobabel</hi>'s Temple as to the Structure and outward Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, was no way comparable to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple. Some indeed ſay, that this Temple was ſo far enlarged and beautified by <hi>Herod,</hi> that it did not only equal, but exceed <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple That <hi>Herod</hi> enlarg'd and beautifi'd it, is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that he ſo improved it as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple, may very well be queſtioned. 'Tis therefore another kind of glory than that which conſiſts in external luſtre and magnificence, a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual glory that God intended when he promiſed, that <hi>the glory of the latter houſe ſhould be greater than the glory of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> And that ſpiritual glory lay eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this, that the promiſed Meſſiah, the Eternal Son of God Incarnate, ſhould
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:61506:312"/>honour and dignify this ſecond Temple by his being preſented there, by his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acceſs unto it, by his corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and by his teaching in it. Hereby was made a far greater acceſſion of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that Temple, than all <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Gold and Silver, Riches and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence could put upon the former Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Now whereas God in effect promiſed, that what was wanting as to external glory in the ſecond Temple, ſhould be made up with advantage in ſpiritual glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; we may hence obſerve,</p>
            <p>That ſpiritual glory is the chief glory; and where this is, it abundantly makes up and ſupplies the defects of other glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This is a truth, the conſideration whereof is not unſeaſonable at preſent. We have here a fine and beautiful Church which draws many eyes upon it; and if there be nothing undecently pompous or gaudy in it, I would hope the beauty of a Church would be an eye-fore to no man. If we adorn our own Houſes without offence, why ſhould not ſome Ornament be allowed the Houſe of God, provided that ſuch moderation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency be therein obſerved, as becomes a place dedicated to the Service of God.</p>
            <p>Beſides, I know not but the decent,
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:61506:313"/>chaſte, and modeſt Ornature of a place in which God is to be worſhipped, may be a means of drawing ſome people thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who would not much care to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves in an undecent and ſordid place.</p>
            <q>
               <l>

               </l>

            <p>But yet however, we muſt take heed that we place not too much in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things; that we pleaſe not our ſelves too much in them. When all is done, Spiritual Ornaments are the only Ornaments, and Spiritual Glory the true Glory: If that be wanting to this place, all other glory will ſignify little. Sin marrs the beauty, and ſtains the glory of any place or people. Sound Doctrine, pure Ordinances, ſpiritual Worſhip, the holineſs and unblameableneſs of our Lives, the converſion of Sinners, the turning of many to righteouſneſs; theſe are the things that will more beautify and adorn this place, that will reflect more true and ſubſtantial Glory on it, than all the Coſt and Art that hath been expended and laid out upon it to adorn and beautify it.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the things that would make <hi>the glory of this latter houſe greater than the glory of the former.</hi>
